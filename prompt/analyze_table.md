# Tables Analysis Agent

## 📋 Task Description
Analyze the following CSV tables generated by the code execution. Provide a comprehensive summary of all tables, focusing on their purpose and informational content.

## 🧩 Tables to Analyze
{tables_data}

## 🎯 Analysis Requirements
For each table, answer the following questions:
1. **Purpose Identification**: What is the primary purpose of this table? (e.g., performance metrics storage, prediction results, feature importance scores, ablation study results, statistical test results, etc.)
2. **Content Summary**: What specific information does this table convey?
3. **Structural Analysis**: What is the structure and data types present?
4. **Data Quality Assessment**: Based on the sample, what can be inferred about data quality?

## 📊 Output Format
Provide your analysis in the following structure:

### Table Analysis Summary

**Total Tables Generated**: {number_of_tables}

**Table-by-Table Analysis**:
1. **[Table 1 Filename]**:
   - **Purpose**: [Primary function and intended use]
   - **Content**: [Key information and metrics conveyed]
   - **Structure**: [Rows × Columns, column types, data format]
   - **Quality Indicators**: [Completeness, consistency, formatting]

2. **[Table 2 Filename]**:
   ... [repeat for all tables]

**Cross-Table Relationships**:
- [Describe relationships and dependencies between tables]
- [How tables complement each other in the analysis]

**Overall Assessment**:
- Completeness and comprehensiveness of data exports
- Appropriateness of table structures for their purposes
- Suggestions for improvement or additional tables needed

## 📝 Evaluation Guidelines
- Focus on understanding the informational content, not detailed statistical analysis
- Identify if tables contain critical results (performance metrics, predictions, feature importance)
- Check for consistency between table structures and the methodology requirements
- Note any potential data quality issues or formatting problems
- Assess whether the tables support reproducibility and further analysis

## ⚠️ Critical Issues to Identify
- Missing essential result tables (performance metrics, predictions)
- Inconsistent data formats across tables
- Potential data integrity issues
- Tables that do not align with methodology requirements
- Missing metadata or documentation in table contents

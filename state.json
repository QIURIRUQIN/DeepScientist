Regular monitoring of key water quality parameters is important for assessing its the hydrological status in conjunction with air-pollution interaction. In this study, a new cost -effective technique based on the geo-ecological information-modeling system (GIMS) is implemented employing the combined use of simulation experiments and in field observations to investigate the problem of optimizing water quality monitoring. The GIMS, is accompanied by 39 elements selected in 8 management systems and 31 functional elements, which are described in detail. It is shown that the combined use of model and field observations allows reliable recording of water quality and optimization of the monitoring regime. Finally, simulation experiments in a lagoon are presented, demonstrating the fidelity of the proposed modelling system to optimize water quality control through regular in field measurements and simulations.\n\nKeywords: Water quality; lagoon ecosystem; soil-plant formations; air parameters; model, insitu measurements\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThere is no doubt that human activities sometimes have devastating effects on the environment [1-3]. The composition of the atmosphere changes over time not only in quality but also in the quantity of its components. The causes of these changes are both natural and anthropogenic [4-6]. The percentage contribution of each component is not always known with sufficient accuracy. A classic example the last four decades is the ozone depletion and its feedbacs [7-13]. Groundbased, satellite-borne, balloon and aircraft instrumentation gathered a large dataset to study the global ozone concentration variability [14, 15]. Undoubtedly, the anthropogenic contribution to the decrease of the ozone amount in the stratosphere and the increase of ozone in the troposphere has proven experimentally [16-21]. The latter contributes greatly to the photochemical smog effect of the megacties and the temperature structure in the troposphere [22-27].\n\nHuman activities, apart from the deterioration of the atmosphere, also alter the quality of water. For example, according to current estimates, millions of tons of manure are produced annually, which is often stored for long periods in tanks or lagoons. This activity causes additional atmospheric pollution with various hazardous gases, like H2S, CH4, NH3 and CO2, which among others enhance the atmospheric greenhouse effect (e.g. [28-30]).\n\nNuoc Ngot Lagoon is located in South Vietnam (Binh Dinh Province, 14 \uf0b0 9 \uf0a2 0 \uf0a2 \uf0a2 N, 109 \uf0b0 10 \uf0a2 59 \uf0a2 \uf0a2 E) in the zone where there are intense anthropogenic activities, which are mainly related to agriculture [31-33]. The importance of the lagoon ecosystem is determined by its productivity that is assessed by fish and shrimp fishery. Protection of the high efficiency of the lagoon ecosystem takes place through a traditional monitoring system that includes in-situ measurements of the water quality. A geo-ecological information-modeling system (GIMS) that includes GIS-technology functions has been recently proposed [34]. This paper adopts the GIMS and applies it in the Nuoc Ngot Lagoon area.\n\nThe basic function of GIMS is the optimization of the monitoring process in order to integrate and coordinate the collection of monitoring data obtained from various instrumentation tools in episodic time periods and certain regions in space.\n\nThe structure of GIMS depends on the complexity of the investigated natural field. The Nuoc Ngot lagoon area is characterized by a variety of the soil-plant configurations, including their ecological features and the functions of the climate parameters. The regime of lagoon water is controlled by the exchange between the systems of South-China Sea and the river.\n\nThe GIMS adaptation in the lagoon area requires the development of new algorithms along with the specification of the standard GIMS items, such as instrumental measuring tools and a regional hydrology model.\n\nThere are numerous studies discussing the heat budgets, the energy, and the hydrological regimes of coastal lagoons. In any case, these studies compose specific models to provide the basis for optimizing the monitoring data and the processing techniques. In this context, a natural heat budget model for the Nueva Lagoon in southeast Spain has been developed [35]. This model is only connected with the monitoring process which is suitable for the Nueva Lagon area. In addition, the development of a model for the Lesina Lagoon (Italy} based on artificial neural networks to study the balance of lagoon water and to assess the spatial variability of lagoon biogeochemistry has been explored [36]. By using traditional modeling technique the Curonian Lagoon hydrological regime as a function of the modernization projects of the Klaip\u0117da Seaport was analysed [37], taking into account climate change and the influence of the Baltic Sea. These and other similar models are characterized by the individuality of the model structure and its specific functions.\n\nDirect use of the above-said models for studying other lagoons requires additional investigations and the development of a new model. The GIMS simplifies the solution to this task. The structure and functions of GIMS are oriented to the variety of parameters of a typical environmental system that allow the specification of the components of the nature-society system. These are typical for given spatial and temporal scales which characterize the environmental system under investigation. In this case, a stage of the model development comes into the GIMS adaptation process, when the model is automatically synthesized through the formation of subject identifiers in the GIMS database. In particular, the GIMS structure consists of five levels of functional elements, which can briefly described as follows:. Elements of the first level represent the regional image of the studied environmental system. The second-level elements is structured with processing algorithms of monitoring data. Third-level elements form a spatial image of the studied environmental system that lists the system elements in spatial digitization pixels. Fourth level items produce links between GIS structures and models. Five level items provide the forecasting process and an assessment of the simulation results.\n\n## 2. Model description and its implementation: The GIMS structure and functions adopted\n\nAccording to the general technique employed for the synthesis of GIMS, it is necessary to create a simulation model of the studied environmental object. It should be done taking into account the a priori relevant information and the assessment of the deviations between the model's results and the observations.\n\nThis allows the correction of the model and monitoring regime. As a result, a consistent coordination of the model calculations and monitoring data is established and a reliable forecast is made. The standard GIMS structure has a set of models shown in Figure 1 and Tables 1 and 2.\n\nThe GIMS adaptation process is performed by the GSI item which configures the hydrospherical part of the lagoon area under investigation and produces a universal schematic envelope of the lagoon zone covering the area with a grid \uf044\uf06a in latitude and \uf044\uf06c in longitude provided by the user. A discrete numbering of pixels \uf058 ij ={ \uf06a i \uf0a3\uf06a &lt; \uf06a i +1, \uf06c j \uf0a3\uf06c &lt; \uf06c j +1} gives a set of locations, where each location \uf058 ij has an area \uf073 ij . The introduced grid of digitizing the lagoon zone is identified by a series of subject identifiers that correspond to the lagoon elements. According to this procedure, the lagoon zone \uf058 in the GIMS/NNL database is presented by a set of matrices k ij k a A \uf03d , where k ij a is the identifier of the subject or process in the pixel \uf058 ij .\n\nGeophysical and meteorological data\n\nMonitoring regime\n\nmanagement\n\nPrognosis discrepancy assessment\n\nAn analysis of information and decision\n\nmaking\n\nModels correction\n\nSAP\n\nNPS\n\n1.

Dissolved fractions of contaminants ( \uf078 ) are more involved in biogeochemical processes than in suspended particles ( \uf06d ) [46]. But as suspended particles, the contaminants fall faster into the sediment. Therefore, the MTM item describes the processes of transformations of contaminants, including absorption of the dissolved fraction \uf078 from the plankton ( HZ \uf078 ), the sedimentation of the solid fraction ( K 1 \uf06d ), the deposition with the detritus ( HD \uf078 ), the absorption by detritophages from the bottom sediments ( \uf06d\uf078 L K ), and release from the bottom sediments owing to the diffusion ( \uf06d\uf078 a K ). As a result, the dynamic equations describing the contaminant cycle in the lagoon environment become:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere \uf06d * ( \uf06d w ) and \uf078 * ( \uf078 w ) are the concentrations of contaminants in the bottom sediments (water) as solid and dissolved phases, respectively; Ha \uf078 is the output of contaminants from the sea to the atmosphere by evaporation and spray; i \uf078\uf06d \uf057 is the input of contaminants into the lagoon with river waters ( i =1), atmospheric deposition ( i =2) and ship's wastes ( i =3); \uf062 i is the part of the suspended particles in the i th flow of contaminants; \uf07b \uf07d w z w w v v v V , , \uf06c \uf06a \uf03d is the flow velocity, and \uf061 1 is the part of the solid fraction of contaminants in the bottom sediments.\n\nAs expected, salinity of water is an important feature of Nuoc Ngot Lagoon. The EWQI item controls the indicator of water salinity according to the balance equation below:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere Cij is the concentration of salts in the \uf058 ij pixel, zij is the average depth, Eij = DijAij/Lij is the volumetric diffusion coefficient; Lij is the average length of the pixel adjoining boundaries; Aij is the pixel contact area with others pixels; Dij is the turbulent diffusion coefficient; Fij is the source function describing the external inflow of the salts to the \uf058 ij pixel (with precipitation, river runoff, from South-China Sea and bottom sediments); Rij is the total water outflow from \uf058 ij pixel; rij is\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nthe part of the Rij directed to the border pixels; \uf0ce\uf058 \uf03d \uf02b ) , ( 1 ) ( j i ij ij q r ; 0 \uf03d ij r for border-less\n\nThe hydrochemical characteristics of the Nuoc Ngot Lagoon are mainly governed by the water exchange with the South-China Sea across the barrier lagoon strait \uf047 that is characterized by small tidal basin. The masses of water move along the lagoon boundaries \uf047 periodically to the lagoon or from them to the sea. The velocity of this process is evaluated with the following equation (SHP item):\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere \uf074 ( \uf0bb 6.5 hours) is the tide length, tmax (11, 17, 24 by local time) is the time when velocity of water flow along \uf047 reaches maximal value V \uf047 max ( \uf0bb 425 m/s) .\n\nChanges in the water level in the lagoon depend mainly on the tidal regime and the flow of the river. In addition, the depth of the lagoon is parameterized by the following formula:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere \uf073\uf047 ( \uf0bb 45 \uf0b4 10 3 m 2 ) is the pixel area of the strait \uf047 , z 0 is the lagoon depth at the end of the tide, and \uf073 is the lagoon area.\n\nThe external inflow of salts into the lagoon is formed to a greater or lesser extent by the river outflow. Salt sources, such as precipitation and direct outflow of coastal areas, are negligible components that take into account topography (PWL and MCSO items). Hence, the flow F ( \uf06a , \uf06c , \uf07a , \uf077 , \uf071 , t ) of salts of type \uf07a in the state \uf077 with parameter \uf071 is described by the following function:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere \uf059 is the salt concentration in the soil, \uf065 is the washout coefficient, Q is the runoff.\n\n## 3. Simulation experiments\n\nNuoc Ngot Lagoon is linked to the South China Sea from the inlet De Gi and is characterized by the parameters listed in Table 3. The main problem is the optimization of water quality of the lagoon in order to support the maximal productivity of the ecosystem taking into account that lagoon is located in the zone, where man-made activities are strongly developed. The solution to this problem is implemented by monitoring the lagoon, which is based on in-situ measurements at sites No. 1-10 (shown in Fig 4) and in the management of water flow along the \uf047 strait.\n\n14\u00b010'\n\nN\n\nH10\n\n4\n\nTable 3.

The chemical characteristics of the water and the analysis of the bottom samples are estimated in the hydrochemical laboratory of the Southern Branch of Vietnam Petroleum Institute (HoChiMinh City). The necessary meteorological information is provided by the Nha Trang weather station.\n\nThe model GIMS/NNL allows the spatial reconstruction and forecasting of water quality based on in-situ samples. Tables 4 and 5 illustrate the accuracy of this reconstruction. Simulation experiments show that the correlation between water turbidity and salinity reaches the maximum at 25 o /oo. Bearing this in mind, the variations of water salinity are equal to 7-8% in the \uf047 strait, 81-85% at river mouths, and 53-55% in other pixels. The commercial importance of the lagoon ecosystem needs the management of water quality, including its salinity. It can be done with the combined use of GIMS/NNL and the control of tidal processes with the barrier management. As shown in Table 4 the optimal water quality level can be achieved when the GIMS/NNL uses data collected only at site No.1 ( \uf047 strait).\n\nTable 4.

The biggest error occurs at sites 3 and 7 for . 3 4 \uf02d \u0420\u041e Cause of this is the observed anomalous emission of chemicals from the sediments at sites 3 and 7, where the correction of model coefficients in the items MTM, SHP and SEC is required in the first position.\n\nHowever, as can be seen from Figure 5, a precision of 85-90% can be achieved with in-situ measurements at site 1 with a frequency of one month and using GIMS/NNL for the calculations of water quality characteristics during this month. Undoubtedly, this result depends on the reliability of meteorological forecast. Figure 6 shows the results of the simulation experiments, when different meteorological conditions are considered. It is noted that the precision of the forecast stabilizes during the dry season while the wet season is characterized by the lower reliability of the modeling results. The average forecasting error during the dry season was 9.7% less, with the exception of 2010, when it exceeded 10.6%. Wet seasons are characterized by higher forecast errors due to all errors in meteorological data and estimates of coastal and river outflows. Nevertheless, predicting the water salinity and pH is characterized by errors of the range of 10.4%, regardless of the season.\n\n(%)\n\nPrognosis deviation\n\nMaximal prognosis error (%)\n\n20\n\n15\n\n15 -\n\n10 -\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2192 dry season\n\n1 - dissolved phosphates\n\n\u2192 wet season\n\n2 - heavy metals\n\n3 - nitrates\n\n4 - turbidity\n\n5 - salinity\n\n6 - oil hydrocarbons\n\n10\n\n15\n\nPrognosis depth, days of nrediction deviation on denth of forecastino time and on water quality cha\n\nFig. 5.

Table 6 shows the dependence of the water salinity due to tidal processes. The average ecologically acceptable salinity of water ranges between 22.5 o /oo and 24.5 o /oo. Reducing the inflow of sea water into the lagoon leads to a decrease in the salinity of the water due to the outflow of the river.\n\nAs shown in Table 6 the optimal regime of water inflow management is consistent with the water inflow in the lagoon in the range of 300-500 m 3 /s. The duration of the experiment is one, two and three weeks. When the strait \uf047 closed, the salinity of lagoon water is reduced during one week from 23.5 o /oo to 20.01 o /oo during the dry season and continues to decrease up to 16.34 o /oo the following three weeks. When V \uf047 &gt;500 m 3 /s water salinity increases rapidly during both wet and dry seasons. The latter states that river inflows do not balance the salinity of water without supporting it with an average value of 23.5 o /oo (Bui Quoc Nghia, 2002).\n\n\u2022 water salinity water pH\n\nTable 6.

Conclusions and perspectives\n\nFrom the analysis and discussion mentioned above, it appears that the implementation of water quality control in a regional or local hydrochemical field (e.g. a lagoon) requires the optimization task to be involved in the economic and instrumental supply of this function. In this respect, GIMS technology allows this task to be solved using a combination of mathematical and instrumental tools. The Nuoc Ngot Lagoon is a typical mesoscale hydrochemical coastal area, where hydrological processes are determined by the river outflow and the water exchange with the South China Sea. Simulation experiments have shown that in this case it is possible to optimize water quality control through regular in-situ measurements and simulations. The most important component of this process is the up-to-date information on anthropogenic interference in the lagoon area.\n\nThus, the GIMS/NNL allows the optimization of lagoon monitoring through the reduction of in-situ measurements over time and the number of sites. Reliable monitoring results are achieved when in-situ measurements are made at site 1 ( \uf047 strait) with a three-week period in the dry season and two weeks in a wet period. The monitoring process can be automated using an adaptive spectroellipsometric sensor at the fixed position, which allows the evaluation of water quality characteristics in real time and the management of the tidal regime (Krapivin and Mkrtchyan 2016; Mkrtchyan and Krapivin 2016). The implementation of this task is pending and will be explored by the same authors in the near future.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThis study partly was supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research, Project No. 1601-000213-a.\n\n## References\n\n- [1] Chattopadhyay, G., Chakraborthy, P. &amp; Chattopadhyay, S.

Pipeline\nThe GIMS/NNL workflow (Figure 1) follows a closed-loop process for water quality optimization:  \n1. **Data Ingestion**: Geophysical/meteorological data, in-situ observations, and pollutant source information are fed into the **UII**.  \n2. **Database Integration**: Data is stored in the **Database and Knowledge Base**, with subject identifiers (GSI) digitizing the lagoon into spatial pixels (Figure 2).  \n3. **Model Execution**: The **FWSM** initializes the water balance model, while **CPP** parameterizes energy/matter flows. The **WBM** and **MCSO** simulate hydrological processes, and **MTM** models contaminant transformations (Equation 1).  \n4. **Water Quality Assessment**: The **EWQI** computes indicators (e.g., salinity via Equation 2), and **FMI** generates spatial maps.  \n5. **Discrepancy Analysis**: The **Prognosis Discrepancy Assessment** module compares model outputs to in-situ data, with **MSDM** (NPS/SAP) quantifying errors (Tables 4\u20135).  \n6. **Decision Making**: The **Analysis of Information and Decision Making** module uses discrepancy results to adjust the monitoring regime (e.g., site frequency).  \n7. **Model Correction**: The **Models Correction** module refines parameters (e.g., MTM coefficients) based on decision outputs, closing the loop.  \n\n## 1.3 Key Formulations\n### Contaminant Cycle Dynamics\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mu^*}{dt} = -K_1\\mu + \\mu\\xi L K - \\mu\\xi a K, \\quad \\frac{d\\xi^*}{dt} = -H_Z \\xi - H_D \\xi + \\sum_i \\beta_i \\Omega_{i\\xi\\mu} - \\alpha_1 \\mu^*\n$$  \nDescribes the transformation of contaminants in bottom sediments ($\\mu^*$) and water ($\\xi^*$).

These alterations pose significant threats to ecosystem integrity, human health, and cultural heritage. Among these, artificial light at night (ALAN) has emerged as a pervasive and growing pollutant, disrupting nocturnal environments, wildlife behavior, physiological rhythms, and obscuring the starry sky. Concurrently, the contamination of water bodies by chemical, nutrient, and particulate pollutants remains a critical challenge for environmental management and public health. Effective monitoring, quantification, and regulation of these pollutants require robust, scientifically-grounded frameworks that can translate environmental exposure into actionable metrics for science and policy.\\n\\nTraditionally, light pollution has been described and measured using photometric quantities (e.g., luminance, illuminance) rooted in human visual perception. While effective for lighting design, this surface-flux-based formulation has inadvertently framed light as an exceptional form of pollution, distinct from classical air pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) or gaseous contaminants, which are standardly expressed as volume concentrations. This conceptual separation obscures the fundamental physical reality of light as a flow of discrete photons propagating through and interacting with the atmospheric medium. A rigorous description of light pollution in terms of anthropogenic photon volume concentration offers a unified framework, aligning it with conventional air pollution paradigms and providing deeper insights for environmental and health research.\\n\\nIn parallel, monitoring the complex interplay of air and water pollution in dynamic systems like coastal lagoons demands sophisticated, cost-effective approaches. Traditional monitoring relying solely on periodic in-situ measurements is often spatially and temporally limited, resource-intensive, and insufficient for comprehensive environmental assessment. The integration of simulation modeling with observational data presents a promising pathway to optimize monitoring regimes, interpolate spatial patterns, and forecast system states, thereby enhancing the efficiency and reliability of environmental diagnostics.\\n\\nThis report synthesizes two pivotal contributions that address these respective challenges. First, we examine the novel formulation of light pollution as the volume concentration of anthropogenic photons, establishing explicit conversion equations with traditional photometric quantities. Second, we review the application of a Geo-ecological Information-Modeling System (GIMS) for optimizing water quality monitoring in a coastal lagoon, demonstrating the synergy between numerical modeling and field measurements. Together, these works advance the methodological toolkit for environmental science, promoting more integrated, physical, and efficient approaches to quantifying and managing anthropogenic pollution.\\n\\n#\\n\\n# Related Works\\n\\nThe study of anthropogenic pollution spans diverse disciplines, employing varied methodologies for quantification, monitoring, and impact assessment. Existing literature reveals distinct trajectories for light pollution and hydro-chemical pollution, with emerging needs for conceptual unification and methodological innovation.\\n\\n**Light Pollution: From Photometry to Physical Concentration**\\nLight pollution research has historically been grounded in astronomy and visual photometry. Seminal works, such as the first world atlas of artificial night sky brightness by Cinzano et al. (2001), utilized satellite-derived radiance data and scattering models to map skyglow. Subsequent research extensively documented the adverse effects of ALAN on wildlife ecology, including disrupted migration, predation, and reproduction in various species (Longcore & Rich, 2004; H\u00f6lker et al., 2010), and on human health, linking it to circadian rhythm disruption and associated diseases (Stevens et al., 2014; Garc\u00eda-S\u00e1enz et al., 2018). The quantification of these effects, however, has largely relied on photometric measures (lux, cd/m\u00b2) or radiometric equivalents, which are inherently tied to human vision or energy flux.\\n\\nThe conceptualization of light as a particle pollutant was pioneered by Cinzano and Falchi (2012, 2014), who introduced the idea of describing light pollution through the concentration of \"light particles\" in the atmosphere. This approach aligns with the quantum nature of light and its scattering processes. Recent advancements in environmental photobiology further underscore the need for a photon-based description, as the photochemical interactions in biological receptors\u2014from human retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) to insect opsins\u2014occur at the quantum level (Nilsson & Smolka, 2021; CIE, 2018). Despite this, a comprehensive, generalizable mathematical framework converting standard photometric and radiometric quantities into photon volume concentrations for any spectral sensitivity band has been lacking. This gap limits the ability to treat light pollution on equal footing with other atmospheric pollutants in regulatory contexts.\\n\\n**Water and Air Pollution Monitoring: From Observations to Modeling Systems**\\nMonitoring of water quality and air pollution has evolved from simple point measurements to complex integrated systems. Traditional approaches depend on networks of in-situ sensors and laboratory analysis of collected samples, which can be spatially sparse and temporally intermittent. To overcome these limitations, researchers have increasingly turned to mechanistic numerical models that simulate hydrological, hydrodynamic, and biogeochemical processes (e.g., Rodriguez-Rodriguez & Moreno-Ostos, 2006; Ferrarin et al., 2013). These models, however, are often system-specific and require significant customization for new sites.\\n\\nThe integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with environmental models has been a significant step forward, enabling spatial data management and visualization. The Geo-ecological Information-Modeling System (GIMS) technology represents an advanced evolution of this integration. As detailed by Krapivin et al. (2015), GIMS provides a structured, multi-level framework for synthesizing a priori knowledge, simulation models, and heterogeneous monitoring data (geophysical, meteorological, in-situ measurements) into a coordinated decision-support tool. Its application to optimize monitoring regimes\u2014by reducing the required frequency and spatial density of measurements while maintaining forecast reliability\u2014addresses a critical economic and logistical challenge in environmental management. Prior applications have shown promise, but demonstrations in complex, anthropogenically-influenced coastal lagoons with active water exchange remain limited.\\n\\n**Identified Research Gaps**\\nA critical review of the literature reveals two interconnected gaps. First, there is a need for a standardized, physically-consistent framework to quantify light pollution that facilitates its direct comparison and integration with other atmospheric pollutants in regulatory and public health contexts. Second, there is a need for generalized, adaptable methodologies to optimize the monitoring of interconnected air-water pollution in dynamic environments, minimizing costs while maximizing informational yield. The works synthesized herein directly address these gaps: the first by providing the fundamental equations to express light pollution as photon volume concentration, and the second by demonstrating the practical optimization of a lagoon monitoring network using an adaptive GIMS framework. Together, they contribute to a more unified and efficient science of anthropogenic pollution assessment.'}\n\n### Available Methodology Summaries\n{'2210.14131v1_methodology.md': '# 2210.14131v1 - Methodology\\n\\n\\nmethodology_writer_tool(paper_id=\\'2210.14131v1\\', methodology_content=\\'# Methodology\\\\n\\\\n## 1.1 Model Architecture\\\\nThe methodology centers on converting traditional radiometric/photometric quantities (surface fluxes) to photon volume concentrations, enabling light pollution to be framed as an air pollutant.

The system would use the photon concentration framework to treat ALAN as a standard atmospheric pollutant, and the GIMS architecture to dynamically optimize a sparse sensor network for monitoring the coupled air-water pollution state in a coastal environment.\n\n### Previous Literature Base (Already Reviewed):\n{'report_draft.md': '# Introduction\\n\\nAnthropogenic activities have profoundly altered the natural environment, introducing a diverse array of pollutants into atmospheric and aquatic systems. These alterations pose significant threats to ecosystem integrity, human health, and cultural heritage. Among these, artificial light at night (ALAN) has emerged as a pervasive and growing pollutant, disrupting nocturnal environments, wildlife behavior, physiological rhythms, and obscuring the starry sky. Concurrently, the contamination of water bodies by chemical, nutrient, and particulate pollutants remains a critical challenge for environmental management and public health. Effective monitoring, quantification, and regulation of these pollutants require robust, scientifically-grounded frameworks that can translate environmental exposure into actionable metrics for science and policy.\\n\\nTraditionally, light pollution has been described and measured using photometric quantities (e.g., luminance, illuminance) rooted in human visual perception. While effective for lighting design, this surface-flux-based formulation has inadvertently framed light as an exceptional form of pollution, distinct from classical air pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) or gaseous contaminants, which are standardly expressed as volume concentrations. This conceptual separation obscures the fundamental physical reality of light as a flow of discrete photons propagating through and interacting with the atmospheric medium. A rigorous description of light pollution in terms of anthropogenic photon volume concentration offers a unified framework, aligning it with conventional air pollution paradigms and providing deeper insights for environmental and health research.\\n\\nIn parallel, monitoring the complex interplay of air and water pollution in dynamic systems like coastal lagoons demands sophisticated, cost-effective approaches. Traditional monitoring relying solely on periodic in-situ measurements is often spatially and temporally limited, resource-intensive, and insufficient for comprehensive environmental assessment. The integration of simulation modeling with observational data presents a promising pathway to optimize monitoring regimes, interpolate spatial patterns, and forecast system states, thereby enhancing the efficiency and reliability of environmental diagnostics.\\n\\nThis report synthesizes two pivotal contributions that address these respective challenges. First, we examine the novel formulation of light pollution as the volume concentration of anthropogenic photons, establishing explicit conversion equations with traditional photometric quantities. Second, we review the application of a Geo-ecological Information-Modeling System (GIMS) for optimizing water quality monitoring in a coastal lagoon, demonstrating the synergy between numerical modeling and field measurements. Together, these works advance the methodological toolkit for environmental science, promoting more integrated, physical, and efficient approaches to quantifying and managing anthropogenic pollution.\\n\\n#\\n\\n# Related Works\\n\\nThe study of anthropogenic pollution spans diverse disciplines, employing varied methodologies for quantification, monitoring, and impact assessment. Existing literature reveals distinct trajectories for light pollution and hydro-chemical pollution, with emerging needs for conceptual unification and methodological innovation.\\n\\n**Light Pollution: From Photometry to Physical Concentration**\\nLight pollution research has historically been grounded in astronomy and visual photometry. Seminal works, such as the first world atlas of artificial night sky brightness by Cinzano et al. (2001), utilized satellite-derived radiance data and scattering models to map skyglow. Subsequent research extensively documented the adverse effects of ALAN on wildlife ecology, including disrupted migration, predation, and reproduction in various species (Longcore & Rich, 2004; H\u00f6lker et al., 2010), and on human health, linking it to circadian rhythm disruption and associated diseases (Stevens et al., 2014; Garc\u00eda-S\u00e1enz et al., 2018). The quantification of these effects, however, has largely relied on photometric measures (lux, cd/m\u00b2) or radiometric equivalents, which are inherently tied to human vision or energy flux.\\n\\nThe conceptualization of light as a particle pollutant was pioneered by Cinzano and Falchi (2012, 2014), who introduced the idea of describing light pollution through the concentration of \"light particles\" in the atmosphere. This approach aligns with the quantum nature of light and its scattering processes. Recent advancements in environmental photobiology further underscore the need for a photon-based description, as the photochemical interactions in biological receptors\u2014from human retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) to insect opsins\u2014occur at the quantum level (Nilsson & Smolka, 2021; CIE, 2018). Despite this, a comprehensive, generalizable mathematical framework converting standard photometric and radiometric quantities into photon volume concentrations for any spectral sensitivity band has been lacking. This gap limits the ability to treat light pollution on equal footing with other atmospheric pollutants in regulatory contexts.\\n\\n**Water and Air Pollution Monitoring: From Observations to Modeling Systems**\\nMonitoring of water quality and air pollution has evolved from simple point measurements to complex integrated systems. Traditional approaches depend on networks of in-situ sensors and laboratory analysis of collected samples, which can be spatially sparse and temporally intermittent. To overcome these limitations, researchers have increasingly turned to mechanistic numerical models that simulate hydrological, hydrodynamic, and biogeochemical processes (e.g., Rodriguez-Rodriguez & Moreno-Ostos, 2006; Ferrarin et al., 2013). These models, however, are often system-specific and require significant customization for new sites.\\n\\nThe integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with environmental models has been a significant step forward, enabling spatial data management and visualization. The Geo-ecological Information-Modeling System (GIMS) technology represents an advanced evolution of this integration. As detailed by Krapivin et al. (2015), GIMS provides a structured, multi-level framework for synthesizing a priori knowledge, simulation models, and heterogeneous monitoring data (geophysical, meteorological, in-situ measurements) into a coordinated decision-support tool. Its application to optimize monitoring regimes\u2014by reducing the required frequency and spatial density of measurements while maintaining forecast reliability\u2014addresses a critical economic and logistical challenge in environmental management. Prior applications have shown promise, but demonstrations in complex, anthropogenically-influenced coastal lagoons with active water exchange remain limited.\\n\\n**Identified Research Gaps**\\nA critical review of the literature reveals two interconnected gaps. First, there is a need for a standardized, physically-consistent framework to quantify light pollution that facilitates its direct comparison and integration with other atmospheric pollutants in regulatory and public health contexts. Second, there is a need for generalized, adaptable methodologies to optimize the monitoring of interconnected air-water pollution in dynamic environments, minimizing costs while maximizing informational yield. The works synthesized herein directly address these gaps: the first by providing the fundamental equations to express light pollution as photon volume concentration, and the second by demonstrating the practical optimization of a lagoon monitoring network using an adaptive GIMS framework. Together, they contribute to a more unified and efficient science of anthropogenic pollution assessment.'}\n\n## Search Strategy\nPerform a systematic literature search focusing on:\n\n### 1.

This formulation, consistent  with the basic  physics of the  emission,  scattering  and absorption  of  light, allows one to express light pollution levels in terms of particle volume concentrations, in a completely analogous way as it is currently done with other classical pollutants, like particulate  matter  or  molecular  contaminants.  In  this  work  we  provide  the  explicit conversion equations between the photon volume concentration and the traditional light  photometry  quantities.  This  equivalent  description  of  the  light  pollution  levels provides some relevant insights that help to identify artificial light at night as a standard pollutant. It also enables a complementary way of expressing artificial light exposures for environmental and public health research and regulatory purposes.\n\n## Keywords\n\nLight pollution ; nocturnal environment ; radiometry ; photometry ; air pollution\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nArtificial light at night is a key factor for the improvement of the living conditions of humankind. Its production and control have provided us an essential level of freedom, enabling  many  activities  at  nighttime  that  otherwise  would  be  limited  by  the  low performance of the human visual system under typical natural night light levels. Artificial light  at  night  is  also  a  longtime  recognized  air  pollutant.  Already  in  1979,  the  UN\n\nConvention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution, in its art. 1.a), established that ' \"Air Pollution\" means the introduction by man, directly or indirectly, of substances or energy into the air resulting in deleterious effects of such a nature as to endanger human health, harm living resources and ecosystems and material property and impair or interfere with amenities and other legitimate uses of the environment, and \"air pollutants\" shall be construed accordingly\" (United Nations, 1996) with an explicit and consistent interpretation by the UN International Law Commission in the sense that, in the context of the protection of the atmosphere, ''Energy' is understood to include heat, light, noise and radioactivity introduced and  released  into  the  atmosphere  through  human  activities'  (United  Nations, 2018). Artificial light at night has been shown to produce undesired disruptive effects on wildlife (Longcore and Rich, 2004; Rich and Longcore, 2006; H\u00f6lker et al., 2010; Davies et al., 2013; Svechkina et al., 2020; Gaston et al., 2021) as well as in relevant aspects of human  health  (Davis  et  al.,  2001;  Haim  and  Portnov,  2013;  Stevens  et  al.,  2014; Smolensky et  al.,  2015;  Garc\u00eda-S\u00e1enz  et  al.,  2018;  Russart  and  Nelson,  2018;  Boyce, 2022).  These  unwanted  effects  add  to  the  progressive  loss  of  the  starry  night  sky (Cinzano et al., 2001; Falchi et al., 2016; Bar\u00e1, 2016), whose negative consequences for the sustainability of the scientific activity of ground-based astronomical observatories (Walker, 1970; Garstang, 1989; Green et al., 2022), and the preservation of humankind's intangible cultural heritage (Marin and Jafari, 2008) have been noticed since longtime ago. Light pollution levels increase at a steady rate worldwide (Kyba et al., 2017), and their overall impact on the nocturnal environment is an issue of concern, as expressed in  a  growing  body  of  recommendations  (see,  e.g.,  International  Astronomical  Union, 1976; Americal Medical  Association,  2012;  European  Union,  2018; IARC, 2019; Convention on Migratory Species, 2020; International Union for Conservation of Nature, 2021; Brown et al., 2022). Being inextricably linked to human visual experience, light has been traditionally measured  and  described  using  specific  visual  photometric  quantities  based  on  the candela ( \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc51 ), one of the seven basic units of the international system, SI (BIPM, 2018). Visual  photometric  quantities  are  related  to  their  physical  radiometric  counterparts through an internationally agreed set of well-defined conversions, mostly based on the\n\nCIE \ud835\udc49 \ud835\udf06 function, the photopic spectral sensitivity of the human visual system (CIE, 1926). By  applying  these  conversions,  the  spectral  radiance  of  the  electromagnetic  field (usually given in energy units \ud835\udc4a\u00b7\ud835\udc5a -2 \u00b7 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5f -1 \u00b7 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5a -1 ) can be straightforwardly transformed to visual luminance ( \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc51 \u00b7 \ud835\udc5a -2 ).\n\nThe  quantum  nature  of  light  is  an  essential  feature  of  our  universe,  and  the emission,  scattering  and  absorption  processes  of  light  are  often  more  adequately described  in  terms  of  discrete  light  quanta  (photons)  than  in  terms  of  continuous distributions  of  energy  (Einstein,  1905).  The  discrete  formulation  is  particularly  well suited for environmental studies where light plays an essential role as the basic visual input  (Nilsson  and  Smolka,  2021;  Nilsson  et  al,  2022),  since  the  photochemical interactions in the eye retina take place on a photon by photon basis, and also in those cases where very low illumination levels reveal the granular nature of light. Accordingly, the  spectral  radiance  is  also  commonly  specified  using  discrete  photon  numbers ( \ud835\udc5d\u210e\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60 \u00b7 \ud835\udc60 -1 \u00b7 \ud835\udc5a -2 \u00b7 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5f -1 \u00b7 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5a -1 ) based on the photon energy \ud835\udc44\ud835\udc5d\u210e\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61 = \u210e\ud835\udf08  \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52 (\ud835\udc3d) ,  where \u210e = 6.626 070 15  \u00d7 10 -34  \ud835\udc3d \u00b7 \ud835\udc60 is  the  exact  value  of the Planck constant after the last SI reform (BIPM, 2018), and \ud835\udf08 is the frequency of light ( \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc67 ).\n\nThe description of the environmental light exposure in terms of surface fluxes of energy or particles is of course entirely correct and, when given with enough spectral resolution and complementary information about the polarization state of the light, it provides a complete description of the light polluting field as pertinent for environmental and health sciences studies. However, expressing light pollution levels in terms  of  fluxes  through  surfaces  has  helped  to  frame  light  pollution  as  a  somehow exceptional type of pollution, not clearly assimilable to the canonical air pollution forms (e.g. particulate matter of different sizes, ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, or lead), whose levels are normally expressed in terms of their volume concentrations in the environment.\n\nAs a matter of fact, light pollution levels can be equivalenty expressed in terms of the volume concentration of anthropogenic photons (in \ud835\udc5d\u210e\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60 \u00b7 \ud835\udc5a -3 ). This formulation gives the same quantitative results as the traditional radiometric/photometric descriptions  in terms of  surface  flux  densities  and  helps  to highlight the fundamental similarity between light pollution and other pollution types. The  quantitative  relations  linking  the  surface  flux  and  the  volume  concentration formulations are explicited in this paper. Section 2 contains the main transformation equations and a brief analysis of their most relevant features. In section 3 we provide quantitative  results  of  these  transformations  applied  to  two  spectral  bands  of environmental interest: the human photopic ( \ud835\udc49 \ud835\udf06 ) and the Johnson-Cousins V (hereafter \ud835\udc49 \ud835\udc3d ). Discussion and conclusions are summarized in sections 4 and 5, respectively.\n\n## 2. Methods\n\nThis  section  develops  the  main  equations  linking  the  surface  flux  and  the  volume concentration formulations. To that end, let us consider a  small fragment d\ud835\udc46 of  any surface of interest, e.g. the input pupil of the eye of an individual of a given species, some elementary patch of the skin or the ground, or the entrance aperture of a light monitoring device deployed in the field.\n\nThe total radiant energy d\ud835\udc44 incident during the time d\ud835\udc61 on this surface element, propagating within a small cone of directions d\u03a9 around the direction vector \ud835\udec2 and contained in the spectral wavelength interval [\ud835\udf06, \ud835\udf06 + d\ud835\udf06] , can be written as:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udf06 (\ud835\udec2) is  the spectral radiance of the light field, generally given in energy units \ud835\udc4a\u00b7\ud835\udc5a -2 \u00b7 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5f -1 \u00b7 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5a -1 . The direction of propagation of the radiance, \ud835\udec2(\ud835\udc67, \ud835\udf19) , is usually specified  in  a  spherical  reference  frame  whose  polar  axis \ud835\udc4d is  perpendicular  to  the surface d\ud835\udc46 , being \ud835\udc67 the  angle  of  propagation  with respect to \ud835\udc4d and \ud835\udf19 the  azimuth, measured from any freely chosen azimuth origin.  Other variables on which the radiance may depend (time, location, polarization of the light field) are not explicitly indicated in Eq.(1) for simplicity, but they should be kept in mind.\n\nThe  spectral  radiance \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udf06 (\ud835\udec2) is  the  basic  radiometric  quantity  for  environmental studies,  in  the  sense  that  it  contains  the  most  disaggregate  information  about  the environmental light conditions. From this quantity any other radiometric or photometric magnitude can be immediately calculated. For instance, the total radiance \ud835\udc3f(\ud835\udec2) exciting a retinal photoreceptor of sensitivity \ud835\udc49(\u03bb) , where \ud835\udc49(\u03bb) is any generic spectral sensitivity band, coming from a source located in the direction \ud835\udec2 within the eye's field of view is given by\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nIn a similar way, the irradiance \ud835\udc38 within the \ud835\udc49(\u03bb) band, that is, the power received per unit surface (which is the sum of the radiances arriving from all directions of the frontfacing hemisphere weighted by the band sensitivity and by the cosine of the propagation angles measured from the normal to the surface) can be straightforwardly calculated as\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nAccording to Eq (1) the spectral radiance is an energy density, more precisely the energy density per unit time (power), cosine-projected unit area, unit solid angle around the direction of propagation, and unit spectral interval around \u03bb .  Any radiometric or photometric quantity of environmental relevance may be easily obtained by integrating\n\nds\n\nZ\n\nds the spectral radiance with the appropriate weighting functions over the corresponding integration variables.\n\nThe radiance and irradiance, either continuous (based on \ud835\udc4a ) or discrete (based on \ud835\udc5d\u210e\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60 \u00b7 \ud835\udc60 -1 )  are  natively defined as flows of energy through surfaces. However, a fully equivalent and equally correct formulation of these radiometric quantities can be straightforwardly made in terms of volume concentrations of photons. To do so, let us recall that Eq.(1) can be rewritten in terms of photon numbers as\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere \u210e\ud835\udf08 is the energy in joules per photon ( \ud835\udc3d \u00b7 \ud835\udc5d\u210e\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b -1 ) and \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udf06 (\ud835\udec2) is the number of photons per unit volume ( \ud835\udc49 ), per unit solid angle around the propagation direction \ud835\udec2 and per unit spectral interval around \ud835\udf06 ( \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udf06 (\ud835\udec2) has units \ud835\udc5d\u210e\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60 \u00b7 \ud835\udc5a -3 \u00b7 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5f -1 \u00b7 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5a -1 ). The factor d\ud835\udc49 is the atmospheric volume containing the photons that will impact on the surface d\ud835\udc46 propagating at the speed of light during the time d\ud835\udc61 along the direction \ud835\udec2 , which is inclined an angle \ud835\udc67 with respect to the surface normal (Fig.1). The volume of this slanted cylinder of base d\ud835\udc46 is d\ud835\udc49 =  d\ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc50 d\ud835\udc61 cos \ud835\udc67 , where \ud835\udc50 = 299 792 458 \ud835\udc5a \u00b7 \ud835\udc60 -1 is the exact value of the speed of light (BIPM, 2018).\n\nFigure 1. Geometry of the light propagation. The quantity \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udf06 (\ud835\udec2) is the volume density of photons propagating towards the surface d\ud835\udc46 per unit solid angle along the direction \ud835\udec2 (at an angle \ud835\udc67 with the normal to the surface) and per unit wavelength interval. The slanted cylinder volume is d\ud835\udc49 =  d\ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc50 d\ud835\udc61 cos \ud835\udc67 .\n\n![Image](/Users/chongyanghe/Desktop/DeepScientist/outputs/markdown/2210.14131v1/figs/image_000000_17b135fcb77602776c1daa40fa850c84bb2261aa1dc22d41bbc7d8a84c154b65.png)\n\nSince the energy d\ud835\udc44 is the same in Eqs.(1) and (4), and \ud835\udf08 = \ud835\udc50/\ud835\udf06 we get\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nEquation  (5)  shows  that  the  spectral  radiance  for  each  wavelength \ud835\udf06 is  directly proportional to \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udf06 (\ud835\udec2) , the angular and spectral density of the volume concentration of photons.\n\nThis basic equivalence can be immediately transferred to aggregated radiometric magnitudes  like  the  in-band  radiance  or  the  irradiance  in  Eqs.  (2)-(3).  The  in-band radiance becomes:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nThe standard practice for specifying the spectral sensitivity bands \ud835\udc49(\u03bb) ,  including the transmission  functions  of  photometric  filters  and  the  action  spectra  of  several physiological process, is to normalize them to 1 at its maximum. This criterion can be kept in Eq.(6) by defining a dimensionless normalized spectral sensitivity band \u039b(\ud835\udf06) , derived from the original \ud835\udc49(\ud835\udf06) as\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere \ud835\udc3e0 = [\ud835\udc49(\ud835\udf06) \ud835\udf06 / ] \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 has dimensions of inverse length ( \ud835\udc5a -1 ). This allows rewriting the in-band radiance in the form\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nthat can be read as\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere \ud835\udc41(\ud835\udec2) = \u222b \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udf06 (\ud835\udec2) \u039b(\ud835\udf06) d\ud835\udf06 \u221e \ud835\udf06=0 is  the  volume  concentration  of  photons  of  all wavelengths, weighted by \u039b(\ud835\udf06), propagating per unit solid angle in the direction \ud835\udec2 .\n\nAnalogously we have for the irradiance\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhich can be read as where\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nis the photon concentration per unit volume ( \ud835\udc5d\u210e\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60 \u00b7 \ud835\udc5a -3 ) within the spectral band \u039b(\ud835\udf06) ,  propagating  along  all  directions  from  the  front-facing  hemisphere  ( 0 \u2264 \ud835\udc67 \u2264 90\u00b0, 0 \u2264 \ud835\udf19 &lt; 360\u00b0;  \u03a9 = 2\ud835\udf0b \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5f ) towards the element of surface on which the irradiance is measured, weighted by the cosine of the propagation angle.\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n## 3. Results\n\nTo get some insights about these transformations, in this section we report their specific values for the human photopic spectral sensitivity band, \ud835\udc49 \ud835\udf06 , and for the Johnson-Cousins \ud835\udc49 \ud835\udc3d . Similar calculations can be straightforwardly made  for  any other band  of environmental or public health interest (see section 4).\n\n## 3.1 CIE \ud835\udc49 \ud835\udf06 photopic spectral sensitivity band\n\nThe  conversion  between  radiant  units  and  luminous  ones  (i.e.  radiant  ones weighted  by  the  spectral  sensitivity  of  the  human  visual  system  and  expressed  in luminous units based on the \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc51 ) is determined by the CIE photopic spectral sensitivity function \ud835\udc49 \ud835\udf06 (CIE, 1926) scaled by the constant \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc51 , the SI value for the luminous efficacy of monochromatic radiation of frequency 540 \u00d7 10 12  Hz (i.e., \ud835\udf06 = 555 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5a ), defined as \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc51 = 683 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5a \u00b7 \ud835\udc4a -1 (BIPM, 2018). Within this framework the luminance \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc49 (\ud835\udec2) of  a light beam of in-band radiance \ud835\udc3f(\ud835\udec2) is given by\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nand the illuminance \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc49 corresponding to the in-band irradiance \ud835\udc38 by\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nFor  the  CIE \ud835\udc49 \ud835\udf06 (\ud835\udf06) band  the  function \ud835\udc49 \ud835\udf06 (\ud835\udf06)/\ud835\udf06 attains  its  maximum  at \ud835\udf06 = \ud835\udf060 = 550.4 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5a ,  resulting in \ud835\udc3e0 = \ud835\udc49 \ud835\udf06 (\ud835\udf060 )/\ud835\udf060 = 1.8090 \u00d7 10 6   \ud835\udc5a -1 .  From these values the following conversion constants are obtained\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nand\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nThese photon concentration conversion constants can also be expressed in any other convenient SI derived units, with less significant digits where practical or appropriate (e.g. \ud835\udf02\ud835\udc49 \u2248 13.6 \ud835\udc5d\u210e\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60 \u00b7 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5a -3  \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc65 ).\n\nThe conversion constant \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc49 in Eq.(15) can be interpreted relative to the normalized \u039b(\ud835\udf06) band  in  an  analogous  way  as  the  constant \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc51 = 683 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5a \u00b7 \ud835\udc4a -1 is  interpreted relative  to  the  CIE \ud835\udc49 \ud835\udf06 (\ud835\udf06) band.  Recall  that  the  latter  can  be  rewritten  as \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc51 = 683 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc4a \u00b7 \ud835\udc5a -2 . The illuminance in \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc65 is calculated by adding (integrating) the incident spectral  irradiance  (in \ud835\udc4a\u00b7\ud835\udc5a -2 \u00b7 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5a -1 )  across  wavelengths,  weighted  by  the \ud835\udc49 \ud835\udf06 (\ud835\udf06) function. This provides the number of band-weighted \ud835\udc4a\u00b7\ud835\udc5a -2 that, multiplied by \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc51 , transforms into \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc65 .  In  a  similar way, integrating (spectrally and angularly) the photon density \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udf06 (\ud835\udec2) in Eq.(12) weighted by the \u039b(\ud835\udf06) function provides the number of bandweighted \ud835\udc5d\u210e\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60 \u00b7 \ud835\udc5a -3 , \ud835\udc41 ,  that  after  multiplication  by \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc49 ,  transforms  into \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc65 .  It  is important to keep in mind that \ud835\udc41 is a band-weighted volume density: this means that\n\ntwo monochromatic radiations of wavelengths \ud835\udf061,  \ud835\udf06 2 , will produce an equal amount of illuminance (or of any other photometric  luminous quantity) if their respective basic photon densities \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udf06 (\ud835\udec2) in  Eq.(4) are in the ratio \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udf061 (\ud835\udec2) \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udf062 (\ud835\udec2) / = \u039b(\ud835\udf062 ) /\u039b(\ud835\udf061 ) .  This echoes the well-known fact that the same amount of illuminance can be obtained with two monochromatic radiations whose spectral irradiances are in the ratio \ud835\udc38(\ud835\udf061 ) /\ud835\udc38(\ud835\udf062 ) = \ud835\udc49 \ud835\udf06 (\ud835\udf062 ) \ud835\udc49 \ud835\udf06 (\ud835\udf061 ) / .\n\nThe in-band, cosine weighted photon volume concentration \ud835\udf02\ud835\udc49 corresponding to 1 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc65 , Eq.(16), is not as small as at a first glance these figures could suggest. This volume concentration  is  equivalent  to  an  in-band  photon  surface  flux  density  of \ud835\udf02\ud835\udc49 \u00d7\ud835\udc50 = 4.0743 \u00d7 10 15 \ud835\udc5d\u210e\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60 \u00b7 \ud835\udc60 -1 \u00b7 \ud835\udc5a -2 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc65 , consistent with the expected value. Recall that photons just need about 3.3 ns time to travel 1 m. Given a 1m x 1m  detector surface, photons span in that time a volume of 1 m 3 that contains 1.3590 \u00d7 10 7 in-band, cosine weighted photons per lux incident on that surface.\n\n## 3.2 Johnson-Cousins \ud835\udc49 \ud835\udc3d band\n\nAnother spectral band widely used in environmental light pollution monitoring and research  is the  Johnson-Cousins V (Bessell,  1999;  Bessell  and  Murphy,  2012),  here denoted \ud835\udc49 \ud835\udc3d (\ud835\udf06) . This band is located in the central region of the optical spectrum, has a bandwidth of 90.89 nm and peaks at 529 nm with a normalized maximum value equal to 1. The Johnson-Cousins \ud835\udc49 \ud835\udc3d band has been extensively used as standard for reporting the anthropogenic brightness of the night sky, and several key measuring devices (H\u00e4nel et  al.,  2018)  and  iconic  light  pollution  quantitative  models  (Falchi  et  al.,  2016)  are designed and built based on it.\n\nThe photon volume concentration corresponding to the irradiance in this band can be easily calculated from Equation (11), taking into account that in this case the function \ud835\udc49 \ud835\udc3d (\ud835\udf06)/\ud835\udf06 peaks at \ud835\udf060 =  526.5 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5a , resulting in \ud835\udc3e0 = \ud835\udc49 \ud835\udc3d (\ud835\udf060 )/\ud835\udf060   = 1.8959 \u00d7 10 6 \ud835\udc5a -1 . This immediately leads to the conversion factors\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nAs an example of the practical significance of this conversion factors, Figure 2 shows the  photon  volume  concentrations \ud835\udc41 in \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5410 (\ud835\udc5d\u210e\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60 \u00b7 \ud835\udc5a -3 ) associated  with  the ground level horizontal irradiance produced by the artificial brightness of the night sky, in  an  area  comprising  the  Iberian  Peninsula,  Northern  Maghreb  (Northern  Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia), Southern France, and Balearic Islands. The map, in log decimal grayscale,  shows  the  large  increase  of  the  volume  concentration  of  anthropogenic photons in and around metropolitan areas, as well as its pervasive presence in wide inhabited  regions, including  the  coastal  waters  of  the  Atlantic  Ocean  and  the\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\nMediterranean sea. The anthropogenic sky irradiance has been computed by following the procedures and methods described in Falchi and Bar\u00e1 (2021).\n\nNote that in addition to the photon concentrations produced by the artificial light scattered in the atmosphere, shown in Fig. 2, there is also in many places (urban regions, areas  surrounding  roadways,  industrial  installations,...)  a  noticeable  contribution  of direct  radiance  from  the  nearby  streetlights,  whose  associated  photon  volume concentrations would add to the ones shown in this map. 4.0\n\n4.5\n\nFigure  2.

Discussion\n\nIn  the  above  sections  the  correspondence  between  the  usual  radiometric  and photometric quantities expressed as surface flux densities and their associated photon volume  concentrations has been  explicited in a general way  (section 2) and particularized for the spectral sensitivity of the human visual system and the JohnsonCousins \ud835\udc49 \ud835\udc3d band (section 3). The same approach can be applied to any other spectral sensitivity  band  of  environmental  or public health  interest,  as e.g.  different  types  of opsins (Govardovskii et al., 2000),  wildlife action spectra (van Grunsven et al., 2014; Donners et al, 2018; Longcore et al., 2018; Nilsson and Smolka, 2021), or the \uf061 -opic sensitivities of human retinal photoreceptors mediating non-image forming effects of light,  relevant  for  hormone  regulation  and  physiological  rhythms  synchronization, among others (CIE, 2018; Schlangen and Price, 2021).\n\nThe conceptualization of light pollution as an increased volume concentration of polluting particles in the nocturnal environment above the expected natural values, first presented and developed in two seminal papers by Cinzano and Falchi (2012, 2014), can be easily extended to any of the above quoted bands by using Eqs. (8) and (10) of this paper.  Reference  values  for  the  natural  baseline  in  diverse  bands  may  be  found  in Masana et al. (2021, 2022).\n\nThe  proposed  description  does  not  rely  on  a  unique  total  volume  density  of photons,  but  on  the  volume  density  of  the  subset  of  photons  relevant  for  the photometric  magnitude  under  study,  which  in  general  will  be  different  for  each magnitude. In case of the spectral radiance in a given direction ( \ud835\udec2 ), the relevant photon volume density is \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udf06 (\ud835\udec2) , Eq.(4), i.e. that of the photons propagating per unit solid angle and  unit spectral interval along  the  prescribed  direction. In case  of  the total radiance/luminance  in  that  direction,  the  relevant  photon  volume  density  is \ud835\udc41(\ud835\udec2) , defined in Eq.(9) after an in-band spectral integration. In case of the total irradiance/illuminance  it  is  the  volume  density \ud835\udc41 of  the  photons  propagating  in  all directions (cosine and band-weighted) towards the chosen elementary surface, defined in Eq.(12). If the radiometric magnitude under study were the total radiant energy within a volume, the relevant density would be related to the total number of photons per unit volume. Other metrics may require their own density definitions (see, e.g. Jechow and H\u00f6lker,  2019).  The  main  takeaway  message  is  that  every  radiometric/photometric magnitude  can  be  equivalently  expressed  in  terms  of  the  volume  density  of  the appropriate  subset  of  photons.  Specifying  volume  densities  of    different  subsets  of photons (classified by their properties) is analogous to specifying volume densities of different  subsets  of  particulate  matter  (classified  by  their  properties,  e.g.  sizes  as  in PM2.5,  PM10,  etc.).  The  concentration  of  PM2.5  is  not  the  total  concentration  of material particles in the air, but the concentration of the particles of a given size range, relevant for a definite purpose; the same approach is followed here when defining the photon concentrations described in this paper.\n\nThe formulation of environmental light exposures in terms of volume concentrations of photons is a complement, rather than a substitute for the traditional specification of lighting levels in terms of radiometric and photometric surface fluxes. However,  future  light  pollution  regulations  may  take  advantage  of  this  approach  to specify exposure limits (also) in terms of maximum allowed atmospheric concentrations of anthropogenic light particles, seamlessly unifying them with the current regulations of other well-known atmospheric pollutants.\n\n## 5. Conclusions\n\nThe light pollution levels in the nocturnal environment can be rigorously expressed in terms of the volume concentration of anthropogenic light particles. The basic equations\n\nof this formulation and their application to any spectral sensitivity band, including visual and non-visual ones of environmental and public health relevance, are described in this work. This equivalent formulation of the light pollution exposures, consistent with the basic  physical  processes  of  emission,  scattering,  and  absorption  of  light,  provides  a unified framework to understand and manage artificial light at night as a conventional air pollutant.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nAny scientific research work benefits from multiple exchanges with fellow scientists, and this  is  no  exception.

Regular monitoring of key water quality parameters is important for assessing its the hydrological status in conjunction with air-pollution interaction. In this study, a new cost -effective technique based on the geo-ecological information-modeling system (GIMS) is implemented employing the combined use of simulation experiments and in field observations to investigate the problem of optimizing water quality monitoring. The GIMS, is accompanied by 39 elements selected in 8 management systems and 31 functional elements, which are described in detail. It is shown that the combined use of model and field observations allows reliable recording of water quality and optimization of the monitoring regime. Finally, simulation experiments in a lagoon are presented, demonstrating the fidelity of the proposed modelling system to optimize water quality control through regular in field measurements and simulations.\n\nKeywords: Water quality; lagoon ecosystem; soil-plant formations; air parameters; model, insitu measurements\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThere is no doubt that human activities sometimes have devastating effects on the environment [1-3]. The composition of the atmosphere changes over time not only in quality but also in the quantity of its components. The causes of these changes are both natural and anthropogenic [4-6]. The percentage contribution of each component is not always known with sufficient accuracy. A classic example the last four decades is the ozone depletion and its feedbacs [7-13]. Groundbased, satellite-borne, balloon and aircraft instrumentation gathered a large dataset to study the global ozone concentration variability [14, 15]. Undoubtedly, the anthropogenic contribution to the decrease of the ozone amount in the stratosphere and the increase of ozone in the troposphere has proven experimentally [16-21]. The latter contributes greatly to the photochemical smog effect of the megacties and the temperature structure in the troposphere [22-27].\n\nHuman activities, apart from the deterioration of the atmosphere, also alter the quality of water. For example, according to current estimates, millions of tons of manure are produced annually, which is often stored for long periods in tanks or lagoons. This activity causes additional atmospheric pollution with various hazardous gases, like H2S, CH4, NH3 and CO2, which among others enhance the atmospheric greenhouse effect (e.g. [28-30]).\n\nNuoc Ngot Lagoon is located in South Vietnam (Binh Dinh Province, 14 \uf0b0 9 \uf0a2 0 \uf0a2 \uf0a2 N, 109 \uf0b0 10 \uf0a2 59 \uf0a2 \uf0a2 E) in the zone where there are intense anthropogenic activities, which are mainly related to agriculture [31-33]. The importance of the lagoon ecosystem is determined by its productivity that is assessed by fish and shrimp fishery. Protection of the high efficiency of the lagoon ecosystem takes place through a traditional monitoring system that includes in-situ measurements of the water quality. A geo-ecological information-modeling system (GIMS) that includes GIS-technology functions has been recently proposed [34]. This paper adopts the GIMS and applies it in the Nuoc Ngot Lagoon area.\n\nThe basic function of GIMS is the optimization of the monitoring process in order to integrate and coordinate the collection of monitoring data obtained from various instrumentation tools in episodic time periods and certain regions in space.\n\nThe structure of GIMS depends on the complexity of the investigated natural field. The Nuoc Ngot lagoon area is characterized by a variety of the soil-plant configurations, including their ecological features and the functions of the climate parameters. The regime of lagoon water is controlled by the exchange between the systems of South-China Sea and the river.\n\nThe GIMS adaptation in the lagoon area requires the development of new algorithms along with the specification of the standard GIMS items, such as instrumental measuring tools and a regional hydrology model.\n\nThere are numerous studies discussing the heat budgets, the energy, and the hydrological regimes of coastal lagoons. In any case, these studies compose specific models to provide the basis for optimizing the monitoring data and the processing techniques. In this context, a natural heat budget model for the Nueva Lagoon in southeast Spain has been developed [35]. This model is only connected with the monitoring process which is suitable for the Nueva Lagon area. In addition, the development of a model for the Lesina Lagoon (Italy} based on artificial neural networks to study the balance of lagoon water and to assess the spatial variability of lagoon biogeochemistry has been explored [36]. By using traditional modeling technique the Curonian Lagoon hydrological regime as a function of the modernization projects of the Klaip\u0117da Seaport was analysed [37], taking into account climate change and the influence of the Baltic Sea. These and other similar models are characterized by the individuality of the model structure and its specific functions.\n\nDirect use of the above-said models for studying other lagoons requires additional investigations and the development of a new model. The GIMS simplifies the solution to this task. The structure and functions of GIMS are oriented to the variety of parameters of a typical environmental system that allow the specification of the components of the nature-society system. These are typical for given spatial and temporal scales which characterize the environmental system under investigation. In this case, a stage of the model development comes into the GIMS adaptation process, when the model is automatically synthesized through the formation of subject identifiers in the GIMS database. In particular, the GIMS structure consists of five levels of functional elements, which can briefly described as follows:. Elements of the first level represent the regional image of the studied environmental system. The second-level elements is structured with processing algorithms of monitoring data. Third-level elements form a spatial image of the studied environmental system that lists the system elements in spatial digitization pixels. Fourth level items produce links between GIS structures and models. Five level items provide the forecasting process and an assessment of the simulation results.\n\n## 2. Model description and its implementation: The GIMS structure and functions adopted\n\nAccording to the general technique employed for the synthesis of GIMS, it is necessary to create a simulation model of the studied environmental object. It should be done taking into account the a priori relevant information and the assessment of the deviations between the model's results and the observations.\n\nThis allows the correction of the model and monitoring regime. As a result, a consistent coordination of the model calculations and monitoring data is established and a reliable forecast is made. The standard GIMS structure has a set of models shown in Figure 1 and Tables 1 and 2.\n\nThe GIMS adaptation process is performed by the GSI item which configures the hydrospherical part of the lagoon area under investigation and produces a universal schematic envelope of the lagoon zone covering the area with a grid \uf044\uf06a in latitude and \uf044\uf06c in longitude provided by the user. A discrete numbering of pixels \uf058 ij ={ \uf06a i \uf0a3\uf06a &lt; \uf06a i +1, \uf06c j \uf0a3\uf06c &lt; \uf06c j +1} gives a set of locations, where each location \uf058 ij has an area \uf073 ij . The introduced grid of digitizing the lagoon zone is identified by a series of subject identifiers that correspond to the lagoon elements. According to this procedure, the lagoon zone \uf058 in the GIMS/NNL database is presented by a set of matrices k ij k a A \uf03d , where k ij a is the identifier of the subject or process in the pixel \uf058 ij .\n\nGeophysical and meteorological data\n\nMonitoring regime\n\nmanagement\n\nPrognosis discrepancy assessment\n\nAn analysis of information and decision\n\nmaking\n\nModels correction\n\nSAP\n\nNPS\n\n1.

Dissolved fractions of contaminants ( \uf078 ) are more involved in biogeochemical processes than in suspended particles ( \uf06d ) [46]. But as suspended particles, the contaminants fall faster into the sediment. Therefore, the MTM item describes the processes of transformations of contaminants, including absorption of the dissolved fraction \uf078 from the plankton ( HZ \uf078 ), the sedimentation of the solid fraction ( K 1 \uf06d ), the deposition with the detritus ( HD \uf078 ), the absorption by detritophages from the bottom sediments ( \uf06d\uf078 L K ), and release from the bottom sediments owing to the diffusion ( \uf06d\uf078 a K ). As a result, the dynamic equations describing the contaminant cycle in the lagoon environment become:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere \uf06d * ( \uf06d w ) and \uf078 * ( \uf078 w ) are the concentrations of contaminants in the bottom sediments (water) as solid and dissolved phases, respectively; Ha \uf078 is the output of contaminants from the sea to the atmosphere by evaporation and spray; i \uf078\uf06d \uf057 is the input of contaminants into the lagoon with river waters ( i =1), atmospheric deposition ( i =2) and ship's wastes ( i =3); \uf062 i is the part of the suspended particles in the i th flow of contaminants; \uf07b \uf07d w z w w v v v V , , \uf06c \uf06a \uf03d is the flow velocity, and \uf061 1 is the part of the solid fraction of contaminants in the bottom sediments.\n\nAs expected, salinity of water is an important feature of Nuoc Ngot Lagoon. The EWQI item controls the indicator of water salinity according to the balance equation below:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere Cij is the concentration of salts in the \uf058 ij pixel, zij is the average depth, Eij = DijAij/Lij is the volumetric diffusion coefficient; Lij is the average length of the pixel adjoining boundaries; Aij is the pixel contact area with others pixels; Dij is the turbulent diffusion coefficient; Fij is the source function describing the external inflow of the salts to the \uf058 ij pixel (with precipitation, river runoff, from South-China Sea and bottom sediments); Rij is the total water outflow from \uf058 ij pixel; rij is\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nthe part of the Rij directed to the border pixels; \uf0ce\uf058 \uf03d \uf02b ) , ( 1 ) ( j i ij ij q r ; 0 \uf03d ij r for border-less\n\nThe hydrochemical characteristics of the Nuoc Ngot Lagoon are mainly governed by the water exchange with the South-China Sea across the barrier lagoon strait \uf047 that is characterized by small tidal basin. The masses of water move along the lagoon boundaries \uf047 periodically to the lagoon or from them to the sea. The velocity of this process is evaluated with the following equation (SHP item):\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere \uf074 ( \uf0bb 6.5 hours) is the tide length, tmax (11, 17, 24 by local time) is the time when velocity of water flow along \uf047 reaches maximal value V \uf047 max ( \uf0bb 425 m/s) .\n\nChanges in the water level in the lagoon depend mainly on the tidal regime and the flow of the river. In addition, the depth of the lagoon is parameterized by the following formula:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere \uf073\uf047 ( \uf0bb 45 \uf0b4 10 3 m 2 ) is the pixel area of the strait \uf047 , z 0 is the lagoon depth at the end of the tide, and \uf073 is the lagoon area.\n\nThe external inflow of salts into the lagoon is formed to a greater or lesser extent by the river outflow. Salt sources, such as precipitation and direct outflow of coastal areas, are negligible components that take into account topography (PWL and MCSO items). Hence, the flow F ( \uf06a , \uf06c , \uf07a , \uf077 , \uf071 , t ) of salts of type \uf07a in the state \uf077 with parameter \uf071 is described by the following function:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere \uf059 is the salt concentration in the soil, \uf065 is the washout coefficient, Q is the runoff.\n\n## 3. Simulation experiments\n\nNuoc Ngot Lagoon is linked to the South China Sea from the inlet De Gi and is characterized by the parameters listed in Table 3. The main problem is the optimization of water quality of the lagoon in order to support the maximal productivity of the ecosystem taking into account that lagoon is located in the zone, where man-made activities are strongly developed. The solution to this problem is implemented by monitoring the lagoon, which is based on in-situ measurements at sites No. 1-10 (shown in Fig 4) and in the management of water flow along the \uf047 strait.\n\n14\u00b010'\n\nN\n\nH10\n\n4\n\nTable 3.

The chemical characteristics of the water and the analysis of the bottom samples are estimated in the hydrochemical laboratory of the Southern Branch of Vietnam Petroleum Institute (HoChiMinh City). The necessary meteorological information is provided by the Nha Trang weather station.\n\nThe model GIMS/NNL allows the spatial reconstruction and forecasting of water quality based on in-situ samples. Tables 4 and 5 illustrate the accuracy of this reconstruction. Simulation experiments show that the correlation between water turbidity and salinity reaches the maximum at 25 o /oo. Bearing this in mind, the variations of water salinity are equal to 7-8% in the \uf047 strait, 81-85% at river mouths, and 53-55% in other pixels. The commercial importance of the lagoon ecosystem needs the management of water quality, including its salinity. It can be done with the combined use of GIMS/NNL and the control of tidal processes with the barrier management. As shown in Table 4 the optimal water quality level can be achieved when the GIMS/NNL uses data collected only at site No.1 ( \uf047 strait).\n\nTable 4. Evaluation of the GIMS/NNL efficiency under the reconstruction of spatial distribution of the Nuoc Ngot Lagoon water quality.

The biggest error occurs at sites 3 and 7 for . 3 4 \uf02d \u0420\u041e Cause of this is the observed anomalous emission of chemicals from the sediments at sites 3 and 7, where the correction of model coefficients in the items MTM, SHP and SEC is required in the first position.\n\nHowever, as can be seen from Figure 5, a precision of 85-90% can be achieved with in-situ measurements at site 1 with a frequency of one month and using GIMS/NNL for the calculations of water quality characteristics during this month. Undoubtedly, this result depends on the reliability of meteorological forecast. Figure 6 shows the results of the simulation experiments, when different meteorological conditions are considered. It is noted that the precision of the forecast stabilizes during the dry season while the wet season is characterized by the lower reliability of the modeling results. The average forecasting error during the dry season was 9.7% less, with the exception of 2010, when it exceeded 10.6%. Wet seasons are characterized by higher forecast errors due to all errors in meteorological data and estimates of coastal and river outflows. Nevertheless, predicting the water salinity and pH is characterized by errors of the range of 10.4%, regardless of the season.\n\n(%)\n\nPrognosis deviation\n\nMaximal prognosis error (%)\n\n20\n\n15\n\n15 -\n\n10 -\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2192 dry season\n\n1 - dissolved phosphates\n\n\u2192 wet season\n\n2 - heavy metals\n\n3 - nitrates\n\n4 - turbidity\n\n5 - salinity\n\n6 - oil hydrocarbons\n\n10\n\n15\n\nPrognosis depth, days of nrediction deviation on denth of forecastino time and on water quality cha\n\nFig. 5.

Table 6 shows the dependence of the water salinity due to tidal processes. The average ecologically acceptable salinity of water ranges between 22.5 o /oo and 24.5 o /oo. Reducing the inflow of sea water into the lagoon leads to a decrease in the salinity of the water due to the outflow of the river.\n\nAs shown in Table 6 the optimal regime of water inflow management is consistent with the water inflow in the lagoon in the range of 300-500 m 3 /s. The duration of the experiment is one, two and three weeks. When the strait \uf047 closed, the salinity of lagoon water is reduced during one week from 23.5 o /oo to 20.01 o /oo during the dry season and continues to decrease up to 16.34 o /oo the following three weeks. When V \uf047 &gt;500 m 3 /s water salinity increases rapidly during both wet and dry seasons. The latter states that river inflows do not balance the salinity of water without supporting it with an average value of 23.5 o /oo (Bui Quoc Nghia, 2002).\n\n\u2022 water salinity water pH\n\nTable 6.

Conclusions and perspectives\n\nFrom the analysis and discussion mentioned above, it appears that the implementation of water quality control in a regional or local hydrochemical field (e.g. a lagoon) requires the optimization task to be involved in the economic and instrumental supply of this function. In this respect, GIMS technology allows this task to be solved using a combination of mathematical and instrumental tools. The Nuoc Ngot Lagoon is a typical mesoscale hydrochemical coastal area, where hydrological processes are determined by the river outflow and the water exchange with the South China Sea. Simulation experiments have shown that in this case it is possible to optimize water quality control through regular in-situ measurements and simulations. The most important component of this process is the up-to-date information on anthropogenic interference in the lagoon area.\n\nThus, the GIMS/NNL allows the optimization of lagoon monitoring through the reduction of in-situ measurements over time and the number of sites. Reliable monitoring results are achieved when in-situ measurements are made at site 1 ( \uf047 strait) with a three-week period in the dry season and two weeks in a wet period. The monitoring process can be automated using an adaptive spectroellipsometric sensor at the fixed position, which allows the evaluation of water quality characteristics in real time and the management of the tidal regime (Krapivin and Mkrtchyan 2016; Mkrtchyan and Krapivin 2016). The implementation of this task is pending and will be explored by the same authors in the near future.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThis study partly was supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research, Project No. 1601-000213-a.\n\n## References\n\n- [1] Chattopadhyay, G., Chakraborthy, P. &amp; Chattopadhyay, S.

        "report_draft.md": "# Introduction\n\nAnthropogenic activities have profoundly altered the natural environment, introducing a diverse array of pollutants into atmospheric and aquatic systems. These alterations pose significant threats to ecosystem integrity, human health, and cultural heritage. Among these, artificial light at night (ALAN) has emerged as a pervasive and growing pollutant, disrupting nocturnal environments, wildlife behavior, physiological rhythms, and obscuring the starry sky. Concurrently, the contamination of water bodies by chemical, nutrient, and particulate pollutants remains a critical challenge for environmental management and public health. Effective monitoring, quantification, and regulation of these pollutants require robust, scientifically-grounded frameworks that can translate environmental exposure into actionable metrics for science and policy.\n\nTraditionally, light pollution has been described and measured using photometric quantities (e.g., luminance, illuminance) rooted in human visual perception. While effective for lighting design, this surface-flux-based formulation has inadvertently framed light as an exceptional form of pollution, distinct from classical air pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) or gaseous contaminants, which are standardly expressed as volume concentrations. This conceptual separation obscures the fundamental physical reality of light as a flow of discrete photons propagating through and interacting with the atmospheric medium. A rigorous description of light pollution in terms of anthropogenic photon volume concentration offers a unified framework, aligning it with conventional air pollution paradigms and providing deeper insights for environmental and health research.\n\nIn parallel, monitoring the complex interplay of air and water pollution in dynamic systems like coastal lagoons demands sophisticated, cost-effective approaches. Traditional monitoring relying solely on periodic in-situ measurements is often spatially and temporally limited, resource-intensive, and insufficient for comprehensive environmental assessment. The integration of simulation modeling with observational data presents a promising pathway to optimize monitoring regimes, interpolate spatial patterns, and forecast system states, thereby enhancing the efficiency and reliability of environmental diagnostics.\n\nThis report synthesizes two pivotal contributions that address these respective challenges. First, we examine the novel formulation of light pollution as the volume concentration of anthropogenic photons, establishing explicit conversion equations with traditional photometric quantities. Second, we review the application of a Geo-ecological Information-Modeling System (GIMS) for optimizing water quality monitoring in a coastal lagoon, demonstrating the synergy between numerical modeling and field measurements. Together, these works advance the methodological toolkit for environmental science, promoting more integrated, physical, and efficient approaches to quantifying and managing anthropogenic pollution.\n\n#\n\n# Related Works\n\nThe study of anthropogenic pollution spans diverse disciplines, employing varied methodologies for quantification, monitoring, and impact assessment. Existing literature reveals distinct trajectories for light pollution and hydro-chemical pollution, with emerging needs for conceptual unification and methodological innovation.\n\n**Light Pollution: From Photometry to Physical Concentration**\nLight pollution research has historically been grounded in astronomy and visual photometry. Seminal works, such as the first world atlas of artificial night sky brightness by Cinzano et al. (2001), utilized satellite-derived radiance data and scattering models to map skyglow. Subsequent research extensively documented the adverse effects of ALAN on wildlife ecology, including disrupted migration, predation, and reproduction in various species (Longcore & Rich, 2004; H\u00f6lker et al., 2010), and on human health, linking it to circadian rhythm disruption and associated diseases (Stevens et al., 2014; Garc\u00eda-S\u00e1enz et al., 2018). The quantification of these effects, however, has largely relied on photometric measures (lux, cd/m\u00b2) or radiometric equivalents, which are inherently tied to human vision or energy flux.\n\nThe conceptualization of light as a particle pollutant was pioneered by Cinzano and Falchi (2012, 2014), who introduced the idea of describing light pollution through the concentration of \"light particles\" in the atmosphere. This approach aligns with the quantum nature of light and its scattering processes. Recent advancements in environmental photobiology further underscore the need for a photon-based description, as the photochemical interactions in biological receptors\u2014from human retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) to insect opsins\u2014occur at the quantum level (Nilsson & Smolka, 2021; CIE, 2018). Despite this, a comprehensive, generalizable mathematical framework converting standard photometric and radiometric quantities into photon volume concentrations for any spectral sensitivity band has been lacking. This gap limits the ability to treat light pollution on equal footing with other atmospheric pollutants in regulatory contexts.\n\n**Water and Air Pollution Monitoring: From Observations to Modeling Systems**\nMonitoring of water quality and air pollution has evolved from simple point measurements to complex integrated systems. Traditional approaches depend on networks of in-situ sensors and laboratory analysis of collected samples, which can be spatially sparse and temporally intermittent. To overcome these limitations, researchers have increasingly turned to mechanistic numerical models that simulate hydrological, hydrodynamic, and biogeochemical processes (e.g., Rodriguez-Rodriguez & Moreno-Ostos, 2006; Ferrarin et al., 2013). These models, however, are often system-specific and require significant customization for new sites.\n\nThe integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with environmental models has been a significant step forward, enabling spatial data management and visualization. The Geo-ecological Information-Modeling System (GIMS) technology represents an advanced evolution of this integration. As detailed by Krapivin et al. (2015), GIMS provides a structured, multi-level framework for synthesizing a priori knowledge, simulation models, and heterogeneous monitoring data (geophysical, meteorological, in-situ measurements) into a coordinated decision-support tool. Its application to optimize monitoring regimes\u2014by reducing the required frequency and spatial density of measurements while maintaining forecast reliability\u2014addresses a critical economic and logistical challenge in environmental management. Prior applications have shown promise, but demonstrations in complex, anthropogenically-influenced coastal lagoons with active water exchange remain limited.\n\n**Identified Research Gaps**\nA critical review of the literature reveals two interconnected gaps. First, there is a need for a standardized, physically-consistent framework to quantify light pollution that facilitates its direct comparison and integration with other atmospheric pollutants in regulatory and public health contexts. Second, there is a need for generalized, adaptable methodologies to optimize the monitoring of interconnected air-water pollution in dynamic environments, minimizing costs while maximizing informational yield. The works synthesized herein directly address these gaps: the first by providing the fundamental equations to express light pollution as photon volume concentration, and the second by demonstrating the practical optimization of a lagoon monitoring network using an adaptive GIMS framework. Together, they contribute to a more unified and efficient science of anthropogenic pollution assessment."

Pipeline\nThe GIMS/NNL workflow (Figure 1) follows a closed-loop process for water quality optimization:  \n1. **Data Ingestion**: Geophysical/meteorological data, in-situ observations, and pollutant source information are fed into the **UII**.  \n2. **Database Integration**: Data is stored in the **Database and Knowledge Base**, with subject identifiers (GSI) digitizing the lagoon into spatial pixels (Figure 2).  \n3. **Model Execution**: The **FWSM** initializes the water balance model, while **CPP** parameterizes energy/matter flows. The **WBM** and **MCSO** simulate hydrological processes, and **MTM** models contaminant transformations (Equation 1).  \n4. **Water Quality Assessment**: The **EWQI** computes indicators (e.g., salinity via Equation 2), and **FMI** generates spatial maps.  \n5. **Discrepancy Analysis**: The **Prognosis Discrepancy Assessment** module compares model outputs to in-situ data, with **MSDM** (NPS/SAP) quantifying errors (Tables 4\u20135).  \n6. **Decision Making**: The **Analysis of Information and Decision Making** module uses discrepancy results to adjust the monitoring regime (e.g., site frequency).  \n7. **Model Correction**: The **Models Correction** module refines parameters (e.g., MTM coefficients) based on decision outputs, closing the loop.  \n\n## 1.3 Key Formulations\n### Contaminant Cycle Dynamics\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mu^*}{dt} = -K_1\\mu + \\mu\\xi L K - \\mu\\xi a K, \\quad \\frac{d\\xi^*}{dt} = -H_Z \\xi - H_D \\xi + \\sum_i \\beta_i \\Omega_{i\\xi\\mu} - \\alpha_1 \\mu^*\n$$  \nDescribes the transformation of contaminants in bottom sediments ($\\mu^*$) and water ($\\xi^*$).

    "new_idea": "Develop an integrated monitoring and modeling system that quantifies both light pollution (as anthropogenic photon volume concentration) and hydro-chemical water pollution within a single, adaptive geo-ecological information-modeling framework. The system would use the photon concentration framework to treat ALAN as a standard atmospheric pollutant, and the GIMS architecture to dynamically optimize a sparse sensor network for monitoring the coupled air-water pollution state in a coastal environment.",
    "motivation": "Current environmental monitoring treats light pollution and water pollution as separate domains with distinct metrics and frameworks. This separation misses critical interactions (e.g., how artificial light at night affects near-shore biogeochemistry or predator-prey dynamics) and fails to leverage synergies in monitoring optimization. The GIMS system demonstrates cost-effective optimization for water quality monitoring but does not incorporate novel pollutant quantifications like photon concentration. Conversely, the photon concentration framework provides a rigorous physical description but lacks an integrated system for operational monitoring and management. Bridging this gap would create a unified, physically consistent, and economically efficient platform for managing multiple, interacting anthropogenic stressors in sensitive coastal ecosystems.",

    "methods_description": "1. **Framework Integration**: Embed the photon concentration conversion equations (from 2210.14131v1) as a new functional module within the GIMS architecture (from 1709.01443v1). This 'Photon Concentration Module' would ingest standard photometric/radiometric data (e.g., from skyglow cameras or satellite radiance) and output volume concentrations (photons/m\u00b3) for specified spectral bands. 2. **Coupled Model Development**: Extend the GIMS lagoon model to include a simple atmospheric column module. This module would simulate the dispersion and deposition of photons (as a 'concentration') and its potential indirect effects on the aquatic ecosystem (e.g., as a driver for altered biological activity in the water column). 3. **Joint Observational Optimization**: Reformulate the GIMS monitoring optimization problem. The objective function would now aim to minimize the combined uncertainty in predicting both the aquatic pollutant concentrations (salinity, nutrients) and the atmospheric photon concentration, given a constrained budget for in-situ measurements (water sensors) and photometric observations (light sensors). The system would use the existing statistical decision procedures (NPS/SAP) to determine the optimal spatiotemporal allocation of both sensor types. 4. **Validation in a Testbed Lagoon**: Deploy the integrated system in a coastal lagoon instrumented with a prototype sparse network of dual-purpose stations (measuring key water parameters and sky radiance). Use the system to run simulation experiments, comparing its optimized monitoring schedule and forecast skill against traditional, separate monitoring regimes for light and water quality.# Comprehensive Experimental Plan for Idea Validation\n\n## 1.

These alterations pose significant threats to ecosystem integrity, human health, and cultural heritage. Among these, artificial light at night (ALAN) has emerged as a pervasive and growing pollutant, disrupting nocturnal environments, wildlife behavior, physiological rhythms, and obscuring the starry sky. Concurrently, the contamination of water bodies by chemical, nutrient, and particulate pollutants remains a critical challenge for environmental management and public health. Effective monitoring, quantification, and regulation of these pollutants require robust, scientifically-grounded frameworks that can translate environmental exposure into actionable metrics for science and policy.\\n\\nTraditionally, light pollution has been described and measured using photometric quantities (e.g., luminance, illuminance) rooted in human visual perception. While effective for lighting design, this surface-flux-based formulation has inadvertently framed light as an exceptional form of pollution, distinct from classical air pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) or gaseous contaminants, which are standardly expressed as volume concentrations. This conceptual separation obscures the fundamental physical reality of light as a flow of discrete photons propagating through and interacting with the atmospheric medium. A rigorous description of light pollution in terms of anthropogenic photon volume concentration offers a unified framework, aligning it with conventional air pollution paradigms and providing deeper insights for environmental and health research.\\n\\nIn parallel, monitoring the complex interplay of air and water pollution in dynamic systems like coastal lagoons demands sophisticated, cost-effective approaches. Traditional monitoring relying solely on periodic in-situ measurements is often spatially and temporally limited, resource-intensive, and insufficient for comprehensive environmental assessment. The integration of simulation modeling with observational data presents a promising pathway to optimize monitoring regimes, interpolate spatial patterns, and forecast system states, thereby enhancing the efficiency and reliability of environmental diagnostics.\\n\\nThis report synthesizes two pivotal contributions that address these respective challenges. First, we examine the novel formulation of light pollution as the volume concentration of anthropogenic photons, establishing explicit conversion equations with traditional photometric quantities. Second, we review the application of a Geo-ecological Information-Modeling System (GIMS) for optimizing water quality monitoring in a coastal lagoon, demonstrating the synergy between numerical modeling and field measurements. Together, these works advance the methodological toolkit for environmental science, promoting more integrated, physical, and efficient approaches to quantifying and managing anthropogenic pollution.\\n\\n#\\n\\n# Related Works\\n\\nThe study of anthropogenic pollution spans diverse disciplines, employing varied methodologies for quantification, monitoring, and impact assessment. Existing literature reveals distinct trajectories for light pollution and hydro-chemical pollution, with emerging needs for conceptual unification and methodological innovation.\\n\\n**Light Pollution: From Photometry to Physical Concentration**\\nLight pollution research has historically been grounded in astronomy and visual photometry. Seminal works, such as the first world atlas of artificial night sky brightness by Cinzano et al. (2001), utilized satellite-derived radiance data and scattering models to map skyglow. Subsequent research extensively documented the adverse effects of ALAN on wildlife ecology, including disrupted migration, predation, and reproduction in various species (Longcore & Rich, 200{'2210.14131v1_methodology.md': '# 2210.14131v1 - Methodology\\n\\n\\nmethodology_writer_tool(paper_id=\\'2210.14131v1\\', methodology_content=\\'# Methodology\\\\n\\\\n## 1.1 Model Architecture\\\\nThe methodology centers on converting traditional radiometric/photometric quantities (surface fluxes) to photon volume concentrations, enabling light pollution to be framed as an air pollutant.

This separation obscures critical interactions and limits monitoring efficiency. We propose a unified geo-ecological information-modeling system (\\gims) that integrates the quantification of artificial light at night (\\alan) as an anthropogenic photon volume concentration with hydro-chemical water pollution monitoring. Our novel contribution is threefold: (1) the integration of a photon concentration conversion module within the \\gims architecture, enabling \\alan to be treated as a standard atmospheric pollutant; (2) the formulation of a joint optimization objective for sparse sensor network design that simultaneously minimizes uncertainty in predicting both photon and water pollutant concentrations; and (3) the development of a coupled prediction model that accounts for light-water interactions. We present the complete mathematical framework, detailing the conversion from traditional photometric quantities to photon concentrations and the joint monitoring optimization algorithm.

Among these, artificial light at night (\\alan) has emerged as a pervasive pollutant disrupting nocturnal environments, while hydro-chemical contamination of water bodies remains a critical challenge. Current environmental monitoring paradigms treat these stressors separately, employing distinct metrics and frameworks. Light pollution is conventionally described via photometric quantities (luminance, illuminance) tied to human vision, framing it as exceptional rather than as a standard air pollutant. Conversely, water quality monitoring often relies on resource-intensive, periodic in-situ measurements that may be spatially and temporally inadequate.\n\nThis separation misses critical ecological interactions\u2014for instance, how \\alan affects near-shore biogeochemistry or predator-prey dynamics\u2014and fails to leverage potential synergies in monitoring optimization. The Geo-ecological Information-Modeling System (\\gims) \\cite{gims_paper} demonstrates efficacy in optimizing water quality monitoring through simulation-observation synergy but does not incorporate novel pollutant quantifications like photon concentration. Simultaneously, the photon concentration framework \\cite{photon_paper} provides a rigorous physical description of \\alan as a volume concentration of photons, aligning it with conventional air pollution metrics, yet lacks an integrated system for operational monitoring.\n\nWe bridge this gap by developing an integrated \\gims framework that quantifies both \\alan (as anthropogenic photon volume concentration) and hydro-chemical water pollution within a single, adaptive monitoring and modeling system. The core idea is to use the photon concentration framework to treat \\alan as a standard atmospheric pollutant and the \\gims architecture to dynamically optimize a sparse sensor network for monitoring the coupled air-water pollution state in coastal environments.\n\nThe primary research objectives are:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item To formally integrate photon concentration conversion equations into the \\gims architecture.\n    \\item To develop a joint optimization algorithm for sparse sensor placement that minimizes combined uncertainty in photon and water pollutant predictions.\n    \\item To validate the framework's efficacy in reducing prediction error and sensor costs compared to separate monitoring systems.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nThis paper is structured as follows: \\Cref{sec:related} reviews related work on light pollution quantification and environmental monitoring optimization. \\Cref{sec:methodology} details the unified methodology, including the photon concentration module and joint optimization formulation. \\Cref{sec:experiments} presents the experimental plan for validation. \\Cref{sec:discussion} discusses anticipated implications and limitations, and \\Cref{sec:conclusion} concludes with future research directions.\n\n\\section{Related Work}\\label{sec:related}\n\\subsection{Light Pollution Quantification}\nTraditionally, light pollution has been assessed using photometric quantities (e.g., illuminance in lux, luminance in cd/m\u00b2) derived from human visual response \\cite{cinzano2001}. While useful for lighting design, this surface-flux-based approach conceptually separates light from classical air pollutants, which are standardly expressed as volume concentrations (e.g., \u00b5g/m\u00b3 for PM2.5). Recent work by \\cite{photon_paper} reframes \\alan as the volume concentration of anthropogenic photons, deriving explicit conversion equations from radiometric quantities. This formulation treats light as a physical entity propagating through the atmosphere, enabling direct comparison with other airborne contaminants and providing a more fundamental metric for environmental and health impact studies.\n\n\\subsection{Environmental Monitoring Optimization}\nOptimizing environmental monitoring networks is a well-studied problem. The \\gims framework \\cite{gims_paper} combines numerical simulation models with observational data to optimize sensor placement in aquatic systems using statistical decision procedures (NPS/SAP). It reduces monitoring costs while maintaining prediction accuracy. Similar approaches exist in air quality monitoring \\cite{liu2018}. However, these systems are typically pollutant-specific and do not address the joint optimization of multiple, potentially interacting pollutant classes.\n\n\\subsection{Integrated Monitoring Frameworks}\nSome studies attempt multi-pollutant monitoring. For instance, \\cite{smith2020} used a coupled atmospheric-hydrological model to study nutrient deposition. However, light pollution is consistently omitted from such integrated assessments. The conceptual separation of light as a pollutant has hindered its inclusion in holistic environmental management frameworks. Our work directly addresses this gap by providing the mathematical and architectural basis for unified monitoring.\n\n\\section{Methodology}\\label{sec:methodology}\nThe proposed unified framework consists of three core components: (1) a Photon Concentration Module, (2) a Coupled Prediction Model, and (3) a Joint Observational Optimization Engine, all embedded within the \\gims architecture.\n\n\\subsection{Photon Concentration Module}\nWe adopt the photon concentration framework from \\cite{photon_paper}. The fundamental conversion relates spectral radiance $\\radiance(\\alpha)$ (W\u00b7m$^{-2}$\u00b7sr$^{-1}$\u00b7nm$^{-1}$) to spectral photon volume concentration $\\photonlambda(\\alpha)$ (photons\u00b7m$^{-3}$\u00b7nm$^{-1}$):\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:photon_lambda}\n    \\photonlambda(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\radiance(\\alpha)}{h \\nu \\cdot c \\cdot \\cos z},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant, $\\nu$ is frequency, $c$ is the speed of light, and $z$ is the angle between the propagation direction and the surface normal.\n\nThe total band-weighted photon concentration $\\photon$ for a normalized spectral sensitivity function $\\Lambda(\\lambda)$ (e.g., CIE $V_\\lambda$) is:\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:total_photon}\n    \\photon = \\int_{\\lambda} \\int_{\\Omega} \\Lambda(\\lambda) \\cdot \\photonlambda(\\alpha) \\cdot \\cos z \\, d\\Omega \\, d\\lambda.\n\\end{equation}\n\nA key practical conversion constant $\\muv$ links illuminance $E_v$ (in lux) to photopic photon concentration:\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:muV}\n    \\muv = \\frac{K_{cd}}{K_0 \\cdot h\\nu \\cdot c} \\approx 1.3590 \\times 10^7 \\text{ photons\u00b7m}^{-3}\\text{ per lx},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $K_{cd}=683$ lm/W is the photopic luminous efficacy and $K_0=1$ photons/(W\u00b7s) is a unit conversion constant. Thus, $\\photon = \\muv \\cdot E_v$.\n\nThis module is implemented as a pre-processing step, converting raw light intensity measurements (lux) from sensors or satellite-derived radiance data into photon concentration maps.\n\n\\subsection{Coupled Prediction Model}\nThe system state at location $\\mathbf{x}$ and time $t$ is represented by a vector $\\mathbf{Y}_t(\\mathbf{x}) = [\\photon_t(\\mathbf{x}), \\mathbf{W}_t(\\mathbf{x})]^\\top$, where $\\mathbf{W}$ represents water quality parameters (e.g., dissolved oxygen, nutrients). We develop a coupled dynamical model:\n\\begin{align}\n    \\hat{\\photon}_t &= f_\\theta(\\mathbf{X}_{\\text{geo}}, \\mathbf{X}_{\\text{meteo}}, t; \\Theta_f), \\label{eq:light_model} \\\\\n    \\hat{\\mathbf{W}}_t &= g_\\phi(\\mathbf{X}_{\\text{geo}}, \\mathbf{X}_{\\text{hydro}}, \\hat{\\photon}_t, t; \\Theta_g), \\label{eq:water_model}\n\\end{align}\nwhere $f_\\theta$ and $g_\\phi$ are parameterized functions (e.g., neural networks, Gaussian processes), $\\mathbf{X}_{*}$ denote geographic, meteorological, and hydrological covariates, and $\\Theta$ are learnable parameters. The coupling in \\cref{eq:water_model} allows water quality predictions to be informed by light pollution levels, modeling potential indirect effects (e.g., altered phytoplankton activity).\n\n\\subsection{Joint Observational Optimization}\nLet $\\mathcal{S}$ denote a set of potential sensor locations, each capable of measuring either photon concentration, water quality parameters, or both, with associated costs. The optimization objective is to select a subset $\\mathcal{S}^* \\subset \\mathcal{S}$ with total cost $\\leq B$ that minimizes the combined prediction uncertainty:\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:joint_opt}\n    \\min_{\\mathcal{S}} \\left[ \\alpha \\cdot \\text{MSE}_{\\photon}(\\mathcal{S}) + \\beta \\cdot \\text{MSE}_{\\mathbf{W}}(\\mathcal{S}) + \\gamma \\cdot \\text{Cost}(\\mathcal{S}) \\right],\n\\end{equation}\nsubject to $\\mathcal{S} \\in \\mathcal{F}, |\\mathcal{S}| \\leq B$, where $\\mathcal{F}$ represents feasibility constraints (e.g., sensor compatibility, deployment logistics), and $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$ are weighting coefficients.\n\nThe mean squared error (MSE) terms are estimated via the \\gims procedure: a numerical simulator (e.g., a hydrodynamic-ecological model for water, an atmospheric radiative transfer model for light) is run to generate a prior state estimate. The expected posterior uncertainty after assimilating measurements from $\\mathcal{S}$ is computed using an ensemble Kalman filter or similar data assimilation technique. The optimization is solved using greedy algorithms or Bayesian optimization, guided by the \\gims statistical decision modules.\n\nAn adaptive sampling criterion based on information gain $\\Delta I$ is used for dynamic sensor scheduling:\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:info_gain}\n    \\Delta I(\\mathbf{x}_t) = H[\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}_t(\\mathbf{x})] - H[\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}_{t-1}(\\mathbf{x})],\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $H[p] = -\\sum p \\log p$ is the entropy of the predictive distribution. Locations with high $\\Delta I$ are prioritized for measurement.\n\nThe complete algorithm for one optimization cycle is outlined in \\cref{alg:main}.\n\n\\begin{algorithm}[H]\n\\caption{Unified \\gims Optimization Cycle}\n\\label{alg:main}\n\\begin{algorithmic}[1]\n\\STATE \\textbf{Input:} Prior models $f_\\theta, g_\\phi$, candidate sensor set $\\mathcal{S}$, budget $B$, weights $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$.\n\\STATE \\textbf{Output:} Optimal sensor subset $\\mathcal{S}^*$.\n\\STATE\n\\STATE \\textbf{Step 1: Photon Conversion} \\hfill \\textit{(Module 1)}\n\\STATE Convert all historical light intensity data to $\\photon$ using \\cref{eq:muV}.\n\\STATE\n\\STATE \\textbf{Step 2: Coupled Simulation} \\hfill \\textit{(Module 2)}\n\\STATE Run coupled simulator to generate prior state estimate $\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}_t^{(0)}$ over the spatial grid.\n\\STATE\n\\STATE \\textbf{Step 3: Uncertainty Quantification}\n\\STATE Compute prior uncertainty covariance $\\mathbf{P}_t^{(0)}$.\n\\STATE\n\\STATE \\textbf{Step 4: Sensor Selection} \\hfill \\textit{(Module 3)}\n\\FOR{each candidate sensor $s \\in \\mathcal{S}$}\n    \\STATE Compute expected posterior uncertainty $\\mathbf{P}_t^{(s)}$ after assimilating measurement from $s$.\n    \\STATE Compute objective value $J(s)$ using \\cref{eq:joint_opt}.\n\\ENDFOR\n\\STATE Select $\\mathcal{S}^* = \\arg\\min_{\\mathcal{S}' \\subset \\mathcal{S}, \\text{Cost}(\\mathcal{S}') \\leq B} \\sum_{s \\in \\mathcal{S}'} J(s)$.\n\\STATE\n\\STATE \\textbf{Step 5: Measurement \\& Assimilation}\n\\STATE Deploy sensors at $\\mathcal{S}^*$, collect measurements $\\mathbf{Z}_t$.\n\\STATE Assimilate $\\mathbf{Z}_t$ to update state to $\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}_t^{(1)}$ and covariance to $\\mathbf{P}_t^{(1)}$.\n\\STATE\n\\STATE \\textbf{Step 6: Adaptive Scheduling}\n\\STATE Compute information gain $\\Delta I$ for all grid cells using \\cref{eq:info_gain}.\n\\STATE If $\\max(\\Delta I) > \\tau$, trigger re-optimization for next time step.\n\\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}\n\n\\section{Experimental Plan}\\label{sec:experiments}\nTo validate the proposed framework, we outline a comprehensive experimental plan. As complete results are not yet available, this section details the design, datasets, and evaluation protocols.\n\n\\subsection{Datasets}\nThe primary dataset is derived from a Kaggle repository containing water and air quality measurements across multiple cities \\cite{kaggle_dataset}. The dataset includes 3,963 records with spatial coordinates, air quality index, and water pollution index. For our purposes, the air quality index column will be treated as a proxy for light intensity (lux), acknowledging this as a simplifying assumption for validation. Future work will use dedicated radiometric measurements.\n\n\\textbf{Preprocessing:} The light intensity values are converted to photon concentration $\\photon$ using \\cref{eq:muV}. Water quality parameters are normalized. The data is structured into a spatiotemporal grid with 100m resolution and hourly timesteps (synthetic timestamps are generated where missing).\n\n\\subsection{Baseline Models}\nWe establish two separate baseline monitoring systems:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Light-only \\gims:} Optimizes sensor placement for photon concentration prediction only.\n    \\item \\textbf{Water-only \\gims:} Optimizes sensor placement for water quality prediction only.\n\\end{itemize}\nEach baseline uses the standard \\gims optimization \\cite{gims_paper} with a single-objective version of \\cref{eq:joint_opt}.\n\n\\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}\nThe integrated framework is evaluated against the baselines using:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Prediction Accuracy:} Combined $R^2$ and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for both $\\photon$ and $\\mathbf{W}$ predictions on a held-out test set.\n    \\item \\textbf{Optimization Efficiency:} Percentage reduction in combined prediction error compared to baselines, using the same sensor budget $B$.\n    \\item \\textbf{Sensor Sparsity:} Prediction accuracy maintained when using 50\\% fewer sensors than a dense reference network.\n    \\item \\textbf{Computational Cost:} Runtime for one complete optimization cycle on a 1000\u00d71000 grid.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsection{Validation Protocol}\nThe experimental pipeline follows five phases:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Data Preparation \\& Photon Conversion} (Module: \\texttt{data\\_preprocessor.py})\n    \\item \\textbf{Baseline Establishment} (Module: \\texttt{baseline\\_models.py})\n    \\item \\textbf{Integrated Framework Implementation} (Module: \\texttt{integrated\\_gims.py})\n    \\item \\textbf{Optimization \\& Validation} (Module: \\texttt{optimization\\_engine.py})\n    \\item \\textbf{Ablation Studies} (Module: \\texttt{ablation\\_studies.py})\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nWe employ 5-fold cross-validation, temporal hold-out (last 30 days), and spatial hold-out (20\\% random locations). Statistical significance of improvements is tested using paired t-tests ($p < 0.05$).\n\n\\subsection{Expected Results}\nWe anticipate the integrated framework will:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Achieve $\\geq 15\\%$ reduction in combined prediction error (MSE) compared to separate systems.\n    \\item Maintain prediction accuracy ($R^2 \\geq 0.85$) with 50\\% fewer sensors.\n    \\item Complete optimization cycles within 30 minutes on an 8-core CPU.\n    \\item Demonstrate that the photon concentration conversion is accurate (RMSE $\\leq 0.1$ log units against theoretical calculations).\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{Discussion}\\label{sec:discussion}\nThe proposed unified framework represents a paradigm shift in environmental monitoring.

    "latex_evaluation": "## Quality Assessment Report\n\n**Document Status:** Issues Detected - Modification Required\n\n### Critical Issues (Must Fix)\n\n1.  **Package Conflict & Compilation Error**\n    *   **Location:** Preamble, lines with `\\usepackage{algorithm}` and `\\usepackage{algorithmic}`.\n    *   **Problem:** The `algorithmic` package is outdated and largely superseded by the `algorithmicx` package family. Using `algorithmic` with the `algorithm` package (which is from the `algorithms` bundle) often leads to compatibility issues and undefined control sequences (e.g., `\\STATE`, `\\FOR`, `\\ENDFOR`).\n    *   **Solution:** Replace `\\usepackage{algorithmic}` with `\\usepackage{algpseudocode}` (part of the `algorithmicx` bundle). The `algorithm` package remains compatible with `algpseudocode`.\n    *   **Corrected Code:**\n        ```latex\n        \\usepackage{algorithm}\n        \\usepackage{algpseudocode} % Replaces \\usepackage{algorithmic}\n        ```\n\n2.  **Undefined Reference Formatting Command**\n    *   **Location:** Throughout document body, e.g., `\\Cref{sec:related}`.\n    *   **Problem:** The `cleveref` package is loaded with the `capitalize` option, which capitalizes the reference type (e.g., \"Section\", \"Equation\"). However, the command `\\Cref` (with capital 'C') is provided by the `cleveref` package itself, not by default. While some document classes or other packages might define it, it's not guaranteed. The standard `\\cref` command should be used for lowercase cross-references.\n    *   **Solution:** Use `\\cref` instead of `\\Cref` to ensure compatibility and adhere to the `cleveref` package's standard interface. If capitalization at the start of a sentence is required, use `\\Cref` from `cleveref` *only if* you confirm it's defined, or manually capitalize (`Section~\\ref{...}`).\n    *   **Corrected Code:** Change all instances of `\\Cref{...}` to `\\cref{...}`.\n\n### Major Issues (Should Fix)\n\n3.  **Bibliography Style Inconsistency with Academic Standards**\n    *   **Location:** Line near end: `\\bibliographystyle{plain}`.\n    *   **Problem:** The `plain` BibTeX style is very basic and often does not meet the formatting requirements of specific academic publishers (e.g., APA, IEEE, Nature). The document's content suggests a technical/engineering application where a more standard style like `ieeetr` or `acm` might be expected if targeting those venues.\n    *   **Solution:** Choose a bibliography style appropriate for your target publication venue. If no specific style is mandated, `unsrt` (unsorted) is often preferable to `plain` as it lists references in citation order. For maximum flexibility and modern standards, consider using `biblatex` with `biber` as the backend instead of traditional BibTeX.\n    *   **Example Correction (for IEEE style):**\n        ```latex\n        \\bibliographystyle{ieeetr}\n        % OR for use with biblatex (requires different preamble setup)\n        % \\usepackage[style=ieee, backend=biber]{biblatex}\n        % \\addbibresource{references.bib}\n        % ... and in document body, replace \\bibliography{references} with \\printbibliography\n        ```\n\n4.  **Hyperref Package Load Order**\n    *   **Location:** Preamble, `\\usepackage{hyperref}` line.\n    *   **Problem:** The `hyperref` package should typically be loaded *last* (with very few exceptions like `cleveref`, `algorithm`, or `footnote`/`footmisc` packages that need to be aware of it). Loading it earlier can cause conflicts with other packages that redefine internal LaTeX commands for linking.\n    *   **Solution:** Move the `\\usepackage{hyperref}` statement to just before `\\usepackage[capitalize]{cleveref}` (as `cleveref` should be loaded after `hyperref`).\n    *   **Corrected Preamble Snippet:**\n        ```latex\n        % ... other packages ...\n        \\usepackage{geometry}\n        \\usepackage{setspace}\n        \\usepackage{multirow}\n        \\usepackage{tabularx}\n        \\usepackage{hyperref} % Moved to be second-to-last\n        \\usepackage[capitalize]{cleveref} % cleveref after hyperref\n        ```\n\n### Minor Issues (Could Fix - Best Practices)\n\n5.  **Deprecated Package**\n    *   **Location:** Preamble, `\\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}`.\n    *   **Problem:** Since 2018, LaTeX defaults to UTF-8 input encoding. For modern TeX distributions (TeX Live 2018+, MiKTeX 21+), `inputenc` with `utf8` is redundant and generates a warning. For XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX, this package should not be used.\n    *   **Solution:** Remove the line `\\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}`.\n    *   **Rationale:** Simplifies code and avoids a superfluous package load warning.\n\n6.  **Accessibility & Hyperref Configuration**\n    *   **Location:** Preamble, after loading `hyperref`.\n    *   **Problem:** The `hyperref` package is loaded without any configuration. For better PDF accessibility (bookmarks, link colors) and to suppress the default colored boxes around links, it is good practice to set common options.\n    *   **Solution:** Add common `hyperref` options. This improves the reader's experience without affecting printed output.\n    *   **Example Enhancement:**\n        ```latex\n        \\usepackage[colorlinks=true, citecolor=blue, linkcolor=blue, urlcolor=cyan]{hyperref}\n        ```\n\n7.  **Algorithm Formatting with `algpseudocode`**\n    *   **Location:** Algorithm 1 environment.\n    *   **Note:** After fixing Issue #1 (replacing `algorithmic` with `algpseudocode`), the algorithm commands will need slight adjustment. `algpseudocode` uses a different syntax (e.g., `\\For` and `\\EndFor` instead of `\\FOR` and `\\ENDFOR`, `\\State` instead of `\\STATE`).\n    *   **Corrected Algorithm Block Example:**\n        ```latex\n        \\begin{algorithm}[H]\n        \\caption{Unified \\gims Optimization Cycle}\n        \\label{alg:main}\n        \\begin{algorithmic}[1]\n        \\State \\textbf{Input:} Prior models $f_\\theta, g_\\phi$, candidate sensor set $\\mathcal{S}$, budget $B$, weights $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$.\n        \\State \\textbf{Output:} Optimal sensor subset $\\mathcal{S}^*$.\n        \\State\n        \\State \\textbf{Step 1: Photon Conversion} \\hfill \\textit{(Module 1)}\n        \\State Convert all historical light intensity data to $\\photon$ using \\cref{eq:muV}.\n        \\State\n        \\State \\textbf{Step 2: Coupled Simulation} \\hfill \\textit{(Module 2)}\n        \\State Run coupled simulator to generate prior state estimate $\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}_t^{(0)}$ over the spatial grid.\n        \\State\n        \\State \\textbf{Step 3: Uncertainty Quantification}\n        \\State Compute prior uncertainty covariance $\\mathbf{P}_t^{(0)}$.\n        \\State\n        \\State \\textbf{Step 4: Sensor Selection} \\hfill \\textit{(Module 3)}\n        \\For{each candidate sensor $s \\in \\mathcal{S}$}\n            \\State Compute expected posterior uncertainty $\\mathbf{P}_t^{(s)}$ after assimilating measurement from $s$.\n            \\State Compute objective value $J(s)$ using \\cref{eq:joint_opt}.\n        \\EndFor\n        \\State Select $\\mathcal{S}^* = \\arg\\min_{\\mathcal{S}' \\subset \\mathcal{S}, \\text{Cost}(\\mathcal{S}') \\leq B} \\sum_{s \\in \\mathcal{S}'} J(s)$.\n        \\State\n        \\State \\textbf{Step 5: Measurement \\& Assimilation}\n        \\State Deploy sensors at $\\mathcal{S}^*$, collect measurements $\\mathbf{Z}_t$.\n        \\State Assimilate $\\mathbf{Z}_t$ to update state to $\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}_t^{(1)}$ and covariance to $\\mathbf{P}_t^{(1)}$.\n        \\State\n        \\State \\textbf{Step 6: Adaptive Scheduling}\n        \\State Compute information gain $\\Delta I$ for all grid cells using \\cref{eq:info_gain}.\n        \\State If $\\max(\\Delta I) > \\tau$, trigger re-optimization for next time step.\n        \\end{algorithmic}\n        \\end{algorithm}\n        ```\n\n### Summary of Required Actions:\n1.

This separation obscures critical interactions and limits monitoring efficiency. We propose a unified geo-ecological information-modeling system (\\gims) that integrates the quantification of artificial light at night (\\alan) as an anthropogenic photon volume concentration with hydro-chemical water pollution monitoring. Our novel contribution is threefold: (1) the integration of a photon concentration conversion module within the \\gims architecture, enabling \\alan to be treated as a standard atmospheric pollutant; (2) the formulation of a joint optimization objective for sparse sensor network design that simultaneously minimizes uncertainty in predicting both photon and water pollutant concentrations; and (3) the development of a coupled prediction model that accounts for light-water interactions. We present the complete mathematical framework, detailing the conversion from traditional photometric quantities to photon concentrations and the joint monitoring optimization algorithm. An experimental plan for validation is outlined, using a multi-modal dataset to test the hypothesis that the integrated system achieves \u226515\\% reduction in combined prediction error compared to separate monitoring regimes, while maintaining accuracy with 50\\% fewer sensors. This work establishes a foundation for physically consistent, economically efficient monitoring of coupled anthropogenic stressors in sensitive coastal ecosystems.\n\n    \\textbf{Keywords:} Geo-ecological information modeling, light pollution, photon concentration, sensor network optimization, water quality monitoring, coupled systems\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nAnthropogenic activities have introduced diverse pollutants into atmospheric and aquatic systems, threatening ecosystem integrity and human health. Among these, artificial light at night (\\alan) has emerged as a pervasive pollutant disrupting nocturnal environments, while hydro-chemical contamination of water bodies remains a critical challenge. Current environmental monitoring paradigms treat these stressors separately, employing distinct metrics and frameworks. Light pollution is conventionally described via photometric quantities (luminance, illuminance) tied to human vision, framing it as exceptional rather than as a standard air pollutant. Conversely, water quality monitoring often relies on resource-intensive, periodic in-situ measurements that may be spatially and temporally inadequate.\n\nThis separation misses critical ecological interactions\u2014for instance, how \\alan affects near-shore biogeochemistry or predator-prey dynamics\u2014and fails to leverage potential synergies in monitoring optimization. The Geo-ecological Information-Modeling System (\\gims) \\cite{gims_paper} demonstrates efficacy in optimizing water quality monitoring through simulation-observation synergy but does not incorporate novel pollutant quantifications like photon concentration. Simultaneously, the photon concentration framework \\cite{photon_paper} provides a rigorous physical description of \\alan as a volume concentration of photons, aligning it with conventional air pollution metrics, yet lacks an integrated system for operational monitoring.\n\nWe bridge this gap by developing an integrated \\gims framework that quantifies both \\alan (as anthropogenic photon volume concentration) and hydro-chemical water pollution within a single, adaptive monitoring and modeling system. The core idea is to use the photon concentration framework to treat \\alan as a standard atmospheric pollutant and the \\gims architecture to dynamically optimize a sparse sensor network for monitoring the coupled air-water pollution state in coastal environments.\n\nThe primary research objectives are:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item To formally integrate photon concentration conversion equations into the \\gims architecture.\n    \\item To develop a joint optimization algorithm for sparse sensor placement that minimizes combined uncertainty in photon and water pollutant predictions.\n    \\item To validate the framework's efficacy in reducing prediction error and sensor costs compared to separate monitoring systems.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nThis paper is structured as follows: \\cref{sec:related} reviews related work on light pollution quantification and environmental monitoring optimization. \\cref{sec:methodology} details the unified methodology, including the photon concentration module and joint optimization formulation. \\cref{sec:experiments} presents the experimental plan for validation. \\cref{sec:discussion} discusses anticipated implications and limitations, and \\cref{sec:conclusion} concludes with future research directions.\n\n\\section{Related Work}\\label{sec:related}\n\\subsection{Light Pollution Quantification}\nTraditionally, light pollution has been assessed using photometric quantities (e.g., illuminance in lux, luminance in cd/m\u00b2) derived from human visual response \\cite{cinzano2001}. While useful for lighting design, this surface-flux-based approach conceptually separates light from classical air pollutants, which are standardly expressed as volume concentrations (e.g., \u00b5g/m\u00b3 for PM2.5). Recent work by \\cite{photon_paper} reframes \\alan as the volume concentration of anthropogenic photons, deriving explicit conversion equations from radiometric quantities. This formulation treats light as a physical entity propagating through the atmosphere, enabling direct comparison with other airborne contaminants and providing a more fundamental metric for environmental and health impact studies.\n\n\\subsection{Environmental Monitoring Optimization}\nOptimizing environmental monitoring networks is a well-studied problem. The \\gims framework \\cite{gims_paper} combines numerical simulation models with observational data to optimize sensor placement in aquatic systems using statistical decision procedures (NPS/SAP). It reduces monitoring costs while maintaining prediction accuracy. Similar approaches exist in air quality monitoring \\cite{liu2018}. However, these systems are typically pollutant-specific and do not address the joint optimization of multiple, potentially interacting pollutant classes.\n\n\\subsection{Integrated Monitoring Frameworks}\nSome studies attempt multi-pollutant monitoring. For instance, \\cite{smith2020} used a coupled atmospheric-hydrological model to study nutrient deposition. However, light pollution is consistently omitted from such integrated assessments. The conceptual separation of light as a pollutant has hindered its inclusion in holistic environmental management frameworks. Our work directly addresses this gap by providing the mathematical and architectural basis for unified monitoring.\n\n\\section{Methodology}\\label{sec:methodology}\nThe proposed unified framework consists of three core components: (1) a Photon Concentration Module, (2) a Coupled Prediction Model, and (3) a Joint Observational Optimization Engine, all embedded within the \\gims architecture.\n\n\\subsection{Photon Concentration Module}\nWe adopt the photon concentration framework from \\cite{photon_paper}. The fundamental conversion relates spectral radiance $\\radiance(\\alpha)$ (W\u00b7m$^{-2}$\u00b7sr$^{-1}$\u00b7nm$^{-1}$) to spectral photon volume concentration $\\photonlambda(\\alpha)$ (photons\u00b7m$^{-3}$\u00b7nm$^{-1}$):\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:photon_lambda}\n    \\photonlambda(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\radiance(\\alpha)}{h \\nu \\cdot c \\cdot \\cos z},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant, $\\nu$ is frequency, $c$ is the speed of light, and $z$ is the angle between the propagation direction and the surface normal.\n\nThe total band-weighted photon concentration $\\photon$ for a normalized spectral sensitivity function $\\Lambda(\\lambda)$ (e.g., CIE $V_\\lambda$) is:\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:total_photon}\n    \\photon = \\int_{\\lambda} \\int_{\\Omega} \\Lambda(\\lambda) \\cdot \\photonlambda(\\alpha) \\cdot \\cos z \\, d\\Omega \\, d\\lambda.\n\\end{equation}\n\nA key practical conversion constant $\\muv$ links illuminance $E_v$ (in lux) to photopic photon concentration:\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:muV}\n    \\muv = \\frac{K_{cd}}{K_0 \\cdot h\\nu \\cdot c} \\approx 1.3590 \\times 10^7 \\text{ photons\u00b7m}^{-3}\\text{ per lx},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $K_{cd}=683$ lm/W is the photopic luminous efficacy and $K_0=1$ photons/(W\u00b7s) is a unit conversion constant. Thus, $\\photon = \\muv \\cdot E_v$.\n\nThis module is implemented as a pre-processing step, converting raw light intensity measurements (lux) from sensors or satellite-derived radiance data into photon concentration maps.\n\n\\subsection{Coupled Prediction Model}\nThe system state at location $\\mathbf{x}$ and time $t$ is represented by a vector $\\mathbf{Y}_t(\\mathbf{x}) = [\\photon_t(\\mathbf{x}), \\mathbf{W}_t(\\mathbf{x})]^\\top$, where $\\mathbf{W}$ represents water quality parameters (e.g., dissolved oxygen, nutrients). We develop a coupled dynamical model:\n\\begin{align}\n    \\hat{\\photon}_t &= f_\\theta(\\mathbf{X}_{\\text{geo}}, \\mathbf{X}_{\\text{meteo}}, t; \\Theta_f), \\label{eq:light_model} \\\\\n    \\hat{\\mathbf{W}}_t &= g_\\phi(\\mathbf{X}_{\\text{geo}}, \\mathbf{X}_{\\text{hydro}}, \\hat{\\photon}_t, t; \\Theta_g), \\label{eq:water_model}\n\\end{align}\nwhere $f_\\theta$ and $g_\\phi$ are parameterized functions (e.g., neural networks, Gaussian processes), $\\mathbf{X}_{*}$ denote geographic, meteorological, and hydrological covariates, and $\\Theta$ are learnable parameters. The coupling in \\cref{eq:water_model} allows water quality predictions to be informed by light pollution levels, modeling potential indirect effects (e.g., altered phytoplankton activity).\n\n\\subsection{Joint Observational Optimization}\nLet $\\mathcal{S}$ denote a set of potential sensor locations, each capable of measuring either photon concentration, water quality parameters, or both, with associated costs. The optimization objective is to select a subset $\\mathcal{S}^* \\subset \\mathcal{S}$ with total cost $\\leq B$ that minimizes the combined prediction uncertainty:\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:joint_opt}\n    \\min_{\\mathcal{S}} \\left[ \\alpha \\cdot \\text{MSE}_{\\photon}(\\mathcal{S}) + \\beta \\cdot \\text{MSE}_{\\mathbf{W}}(\\mathcal{S}) + \\gamma \\cdot \\text{Cost}(\\mathcal{S}) \\right],\n\\end{equation}\nsubject to $\\mathcal{S} \\in \\mathcal{F}, |\\mathcal{S}| \\leq B$, where $\\mathcal{F}$ represents feasibility constraints (e.g., sensor compatibility, deployment logistics), and $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$ are weighting coefficients.\n\nThe mean squared error (MSE) terms are estimated via the \\gims procedure: a numerical simulator (e.g., a hydrodynamic-ecological model for water, an atmospheric radiative transfer model for light) is run to generate a prior state estimate. The expected posterior uncertainty after assimilating measurements from $\\mathcal{S}$ is computed using an ensemble Kalman filter or similar data assimilation technique. The optimization is solved using greedy algorithms or Bayesian optimization, guided by the \\gims statistical decision modules.\n\nAn adaptive sampling criterion based on information gain $\\Delta I$ is used for dynamic sensor scheduling:\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:info_gain}\n    \\Delta I(\\mathbf{x}_t) = H[\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}_t(\\mathbf{x})] - H[\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}_{t-1}(\\mathbf{x})],\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $H[p] = -\\sum p \\log p$ is the entropy of the predictive distribution. Locations with high $\\Delta I$ are prioritized for measurement.\n\nThe complete algorithm for one optimization cycle is outlined in \\cref{alg:main}.\n\n\\begin{algorithm}[H]\n\\caption{Unified \\gims Optimization Cycle}\n\\label{alg:main}\n\\begin{algorithmic}[1]\n\\State \\textbf{Input:} Prior models $f_\\theta, g_\\phi$, candidate sensor set $\\mathcal{S}$, budget $B$, weights $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$.\n\\State \\textbf{Output:} Optimal sensor subset $\\mathcal{S}^*$.\n\\State\n\\State \\textbf{Step 1: Photon Conversion} \\hfill \\textit{(Module 1)}\n\\State Convert all historical light intensity data to $\\photon$ using \\cref{eq:muV}.\n\\State\n\\State \\textbf{Step 2: Coupled Simulation} \\hfill \\textit{(Module 2)}\n\\State Run coupled simulator to generate prior state estimate $\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}_t^{(0)}$ over the spatial grid.\n\\State\n\\State \\textbf{Step 3: Uncertainty Quantification}\n\\State Compute prior uncertainty covariance $\\mathbf{P}_t^{(0)}$.\n\\State\n\\State \\textbf{Step 4: Sensor Selection} \\hfill \\textit{(Module 3)}\n\\For{each candidate sensor $s \\in \\mathcal{S}$}\n    \\State Compute expected posterior uncertainty $\\mathbf{P}_t^{(s)}$ after assimilating measurement from $s$.\n    \\State Compute objective value $J(s)$ using \\cref{eq:joint_opt}.\n\\EndFor\n\\State Select $\\mathcal{S}^* = \\arg\\min_{\\mathcal{S}' \\subset \\mathcal{S}, \\text{Cost}(\\mathcal{S}') \\leq B} \\sum_{s \\in \\mathcal{S}'} J(s)$.\n\\State\n\\State \\textbf{Step 5: Measurement \\& Assimilation}\n\\State Deploy sensors at $\\mathcal{S}^*$, collect measurements $\\mathbf{Z}_t$.\n\\State Assimilate $\\mathbf{Z}_t$ to update state to $\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}_t^{(1)}$ and covariance to $\\mathbf{P}_t^{(1)}$.\n\\State\n\\State \\textbf{Step 6: Adaptive Scheduling}\n\\State Compute information gain $\\Delta I$ for all grid cells using \\cref{eq:info_gain}.\n\\State If $\\max(\\Delta I) > \\tau$, trigger re-optimization for next time step.\n\\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}\n\n\\section{Experimental Plan}\\label{sec:experiments}\nTo validate the proposed framework, we outline a comprehensive experimental plan. As complete results are not yet available, this section details the design, datasets, and evaluation protocols.\n\n\\subsection{Datasets}\nThe primary dataset is derived from a Kaggle repository containing water and air quality measurements across multiple cities \\cite{kaggle_dataset}. The dataset includes 3,963 records with spatial coordinates, air quality index, and water pollution index. For our purposes, the air quality index column will be treated as a proxy for light intensity (lux), acknowledging this as a simplifying assumption for validation. Future work will use dedicated radiometric measurements.\n\n\\textbf{Preprocessing:} The light intensity values are converted to photon concentration $\\photon$ using \\cref{eq:muV}. Water quality parameters are normalized. The data is structured into a spatiotemporal grid with 100m resolution and hourly timesteps (synthetic timestamps are generated where missing).\n\n\\subsection{Baseline Models}\nWe establish two separate baseline monitoring systems:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Light-only \\gims:} Optimizes sensor placement for photon concentration prediction only.\n    \\item \\textbf{Water-only \\gims:} Optimizes sensor placement for water quality prediction only.\n\\end{itemize}\nEach baseline uses the standard \\gims optimization \\cite{gims_paper} with a single-objective version of \\cref{eq:joint_opt}.\n\n\\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}\nThe integrated framework is evaluated against the baselines using:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Prediction Accuracy:} Combined $R^2$ and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for both $\\photon$ and $\\mathbf{W}$ predictions on a held-out test set.\n    \\item \\textbf{Optimization Efficiency:} Percentage reduction in combined prediction error compared to baselines, using the same sensor budget $B$.\n    \\item \\textbf{Sensor Sparsity:} Prediction accuracy maintained when using 50\\% fewer sensors than a dense reference network.\n    \\item \\textbf{Computational Cost:} Runtime for one complete optimization cycle on a 1000\u00d71000 grid.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsection{Validation Protocol}\nThe experimental pipeline follows five phases:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Data Preparation \\& Photon Conversion} (Module: \\texttt{data\\_preprocessor.py})\n    \\item \\textbf{Baseline Establishment} (Module: \\texttt{baseline\\_models.py})\n    \\item \\textbf{Integrated Framework Implementation} (Module: \\texttt{integrated\\_gims.py})\n    \\item \\textbf{Optimization \\& Validation} (Module: \\texttt{optimization\\_engine.py})\n    \\item \\textbf{Ablation Studies} (Module: \\texttt{ablation\\_studies.py})\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nWe employ 5-fold cross-validation, temporal hold-out (last 30 days), and spatial hold-out (20\\% random locations). Statistical significance of improvements is tested using paired t-tests ($p < 0.05$).\n\n\\subsection{Expected Results}\nWe anticipate the integrated framework will:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Achieve $\\geq 15\\%$ reduction in combined prediction error (MSE) compared to separate systems.\n    \\item Maintain prediction accuracy ($R^2 \\geq 0.85$) with 50\\% fewer sensors.\n    \\item Complete optimization cycles within 30 minutes on an 8-core CPU.\n    \\item Demonstrate that the photon concentration conversion is accurate (RMSE $\\leq 0.1$ log units against theoretical calculations).\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{Discussion}\\label{sec:discussion}\nThe proposed unified framework represents a paradigm shift in environmental monitoring. By quantifying \\alan as a photon concentration, it bridges a conceptual divide, allowing light pollution to be incorporated into standard air quality management frameworks. The joint optimization approach leverages synergies between monitoring different pollutants, potentially reducing costs and increasing the informational value of each measurement.\n\n\\subsection{Anticipated Implications}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Scientific:} Provides a physically consistent metric for cross-disciplinary studies of light pollution impacts on aquatic ecosystems.\n    \\item \\textbf{Managerial:} Offers a decision-support tool for designing cost-effective, multi-purpose monitoring networks in coastal zones.\n    \\item \\textbf{Policy:} Facilitates the establishment of regulatory standards for \\alan based on volume concentration, analogous to air quality standards.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection{Limitations and Challenges}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Data Constraints:} The current validation uses a proxy dataset. Real-world deployment requires coordinated measurements of radiometric and water quality data.\n    \\item \\textbf{Model Coupling Strength:} The empirical coupling between $\\photon$ and $\\mathbf{W}$ in \\cref{eq:water_model} needs careful calibration; weak coupling may limit optimization gains.\n    \\item \\textbf{Computational Scalability:} The joint optimization is NP-hard; heuristic solutions may be necessary for very large-scale deployments.\n    \\item \\textbf{Sensor Heterogeneity:} Integrating different sensor types (optical, chemical) with varying costs, accuracies, and lifespans adds complexity to the optimization.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\\label{sec:conclusion}\nWe have presented a unified geo-ecological information-modeling system for the coupled monitoring of photon concentration (light pollution) and water quality. The framework integrates a novel photon concentration module, a coupled prediction model, and a joint optimization engine within the established \\gims architecture. This integration enables the treatment of \\alan as a standard atmospheric pollutant and optimizes sparse sensor networks for monitoring multiple interacting stressors.\n\nThe key contributions are:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item The mathematical formulation for embedding photon concentration conversion into environmental monitoring systems.\n    \\item A joint optimization objective for multi-pollutant sensor network design.\n    \\item A detailed experimental plan for validating the framework's efficacy and efficiency.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nFuture work will focus on:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Real-world Deployment:} Implementing the system in a testbed coastal lagoon with dedicated dual-purpose sensor stations.\n    \\item \\textbf{Enhanced Coupling Models:} Developing process-based models for light-water interactions (e.g., photochemical reactions, biological rhythms).\n    \\item \\textbf{Multi-fidelity Optimization:} Incorporating lower-cost proxy measurements (e.g., satellite data, citizen science observations) into the optimization framework.\n    \\item \\textbf{Extended Pollutant Classes:} Incorporating additional pollutants (e.g., noise, microplastics) into the unified optimization paradigm.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nBy providing a unified, physically-grounded, and adaptive monitoring framework, this work aims to advance the management of anthropogenic impacts on complex ecological systems.\n\n% References\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrt}  % Changed from plain to unsrt\n\\bibliography{references}\n\n% Appendix (if needed)\n% \\appendix\n% \\section{Supplementary Materials}\n% \\subsection{Detailed Proofs}\n% \\subsection{Additional Experimental Results}\n\n\\end{document}\n```",
